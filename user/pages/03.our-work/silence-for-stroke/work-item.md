## Overview

The Peter Couche Foundation operates within the Robinson Institute at the University of Adelaide and raises awareness and important funds to support innovative research being conducted at the Institute using non-embryonic stem cells from teeth (known as dental pulp stem cells) to treat the effects of stroke.

The original website was built in Joomla 1.5 and branded as the Robinson Foundation. The new website needed to be upgraded to the latest version of Joomla as well as rebranded to the Peter Couche Foundation.

## Solution

PB Web Development redesigned the website based on the Peter Couche Foundation branding as well as the original style and layout of the Robinson Foundation that the Robinson Institute had grown accustom to over the years of its existence.

The website was fully upgraded from Joomla 1.5.x to Joomla 2.5.x and also had the K2 content construction kit integrated.
