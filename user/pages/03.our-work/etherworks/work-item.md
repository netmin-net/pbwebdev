## Overview

EtherWorks is a small but experienced IT consultants and service provider based in Brisbane.

The original website built in Drupal was difficult for the team to update and maintain. They needed a new solution that was flexible, simplistic and easy to use but still allowed for complex features, structure and a high level of search engine optimisation.

## Solution

PB Web Development redesigned the EtherWorks website to be inline with their new branding and range of services.

A full build using Joomla 2.5.x series and the content construction kit K2 was used in order to best organise and present the information to users.

We further utilised the Joomlart T3 framework to take advantage of the cache delivery system as well as the mega menu structure.

Various extensions were used in the website to control the search engine optimisation settings. Centralised SEO management with tools and handy tips were all implemented into the solution.
