## Overview

The South Pacific Tourism Organisation required a revamp of their website to better sell and communicate the South Pacific to the rest of the world.

The members needed a portal to act as their selling point as well as marketing channel to the South Pacific and its regional investors.

The project overall required a large face lift of the current web design and a management and user interface to match. The current website was outdated and required a lot of work to manage and update.

## Solution

PB Web Development provided a full web design, development and consultation in regards to the Joomla solution for the South Pacific Tourism Organisation.

The website is built with a combination of components including K2 for ease of content and information publishing as well as SobiPro as the majority of the website acted as a directory of businesses, services and so forth.

PB Web Development also provided numerous training sessions for the members of the organisation to be able to control, manage and grow the website platform over time.

Various micro sites were built for the organisation including a South Pacific specialists area, Cruise manual information portal, a social media branding website, photo gallery and competition portal, as well as the main website in general.
