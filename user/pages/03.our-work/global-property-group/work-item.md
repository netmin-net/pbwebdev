## Overview

Global Property Group is a real estate sales representative which looks after the sales and marketing of large property developments around Australia. It provides numerous real estate services for niche markets mainly around the sale of property developments.

The previous website ran on a platform called HubOnline which was to be discontinued leaving the Global Property Group website in a situation where the website would be inactive and inaccessible.

The existing website needed to be migrated and rebuilt using another platform that allowed for the management of property listings, as well as easy and accessible content management.

Furthermore, Global Property Group was in need of print design services and additional branding work to help with the sale of properties.

## Solution

The website was rebuilt over a few months from a static base into a dynamic content management driven website using Joomla and a content construction kit called SobiPro. This enabled the customisation of how properties were presented and managed on the website. It allows for easy updating of the website and acts as a lead generator for new business and sales.

PB Web Development provided marketing material design, brochures, and booklets to help sell the properties that Global Property Group were selling for their clients. Working with existing branding and existing marketing material, PB Web Development produced various booklets and flyers that were cohesive to the brand of the properties that were being sold.
