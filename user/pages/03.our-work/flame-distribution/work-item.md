## Overview

Flame Distribution is the distribution arm of specialist factual and lifestyle television production company, Naked Flame Productions. The client not only produces their own shows but also acquires many from around Australia and other parts of the world.

Flame Distribution required a visually appealing platform that show cased their video portfolio for potential media buyers around the world.

The website had to be well optimised and very stylized for the market that they were trying to attract.

## Solution

PB Web Development designed a fresh new website based upon the requirements. The new web design was built with SobiPro, and K2 on the Joomla 2.5 platform. We pushed the limits of visual representation with many javascript effects and user interactions to get the best user experience across the website in general.

Custom development also included an in depth user registration, a complex user access control system and custom SobiPro modules to help display relational data and programs.

The ending result of the web design and development process delivered a professional looking website that was easy to manage and a great marketing tool for the company to help sell and distribute their media around the world.
