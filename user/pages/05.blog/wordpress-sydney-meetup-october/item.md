The Sydney WordPress meetup group has been running nicely for the past few months now with lots of new members, regular members and contributors to the monthly meetups.

![Campaign Monitor](http://killspill.org/images/logo2-campaignmonitor.png)This month we're lucky enough to have Campaign Monitor sponsor the WordPress meetup which means lots of pizza and drinks for everyone that attends. We won't go hungry this month while listening in on an open conversation about WordPress and issues and problems we might be having. This session will not be filmed so please make sure you bring your note pads to take lots of notes.

I'd just like to say thank you to all that participate in the monthly meetups from those that site and eagerly listen in on the conversations to those that actively join in on the conversations and even present topics for the rest of the group.

Video editing has been hard to come by of late as it is done all on the weekends and most of the last few weekends have been taken up with other priorities, especially with upcoming WordCamps and JoomlaDays just around the corner.

I promise to get as many videos up as possible before the next meetup.

As for slides, please visit the discussion group that are available meetup website to gain the links to the presentations from last months meetup.

Please don't forget to thank the sponsors this month as well. Look forward to seeing you all at Sydney WordPress meetup.
