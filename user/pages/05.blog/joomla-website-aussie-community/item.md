Now I've been out of the loop a little bit snowed under with a mountain of Joomla build projects, and a couple of WordPress ones, and during that time, there have been some big changes to the Joomla community here in Australia.

JoomlaDay.org.au has now changes to [Joomla.org.au](http://www.joomla.org.au "Joomla Australia")! Wow, and the website has had a little bit of a face lift with a new template applied to the website.

Other improvements such as JomSocial have also been applied to the website as well. This ia all quite exciting and it all happened while I was working under a rock cut off from the outside world. The Melbourne Joomla User Group has also been a bit more active on the forums as well.

I also noticed that the Adelaide Joomla User Group has jumped onboard and started the AJUG group on the JomSocial side of things there as well.

All of which are good things to see. Greater improvement on the general Joomla community here in Australia. Hopefully this is gearing up for a large gathering later this year.

I think its time to come out from under the rock and rejoin the reset of the world, via my computers on a geek forum. (That sounds the safest).
