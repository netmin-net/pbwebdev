Being able to search a website effectively not only helps the user find content across a website but also increases a websites general usability overall.

Our website's feature suggestive search and advanced extended search functionality to help aid a user find what they are after.

## Suggestive Search

Internal indexing of content allows for a more advanced search engine system that looks at the title and content of a page and ranks the content acordingly to its own internal searching algorithm.

## Advanced Extended Search

The advanced search systems that PB Web Development uses aims to help a user narrow down their search to particular cateogies or areas of a website. Being able to search particular areas of large website's makes it easier to support sub sites or targetted mini sites within a larger heirachy website.
