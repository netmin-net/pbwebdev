We came across this post yesterday about the “Top 5 Social Media Fails of 2012” and thought it was a great post to share. The guys from [link-assistant.com](http://www.link-assistant.com/blog/top-5-social-media-successes-of-2012/) put together a great infographic pointing out some of the social media disaster stories from this year.

Some of these I caught at the time they happened and others I some how missed but all great lessons learnt from each one.
