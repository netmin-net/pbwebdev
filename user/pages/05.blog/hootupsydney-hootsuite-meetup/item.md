![Hootsuite meetup international sydney](wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Hootsuite-meetup-international.jpg)From previous blogs posts here at PB Web Development you may be able to tell that we use the social media dashboard tool, [HootSuite](http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-6368991-10920312) quite heavily here when managing our social media campaigns.

We were all pretty excited to hear that HootSuite were putting on a few events here in Australia as a part of the ending of the Australian version of the “Amazing Race” over in Vancouver where the HootSuite offices reside. Looks like we're going to experience the first HootSuite Meetup!

One event in particular in Sydney we're definately going to go to and I'm hoping to drag along our social media interns as well.

## \#HootUpSydney

Join HootSuite Enterprise Owl, Jet Gray at the** PPR Boardroom** on **November 1** at** 6:30 PM** (UTC+10) for casual drinks and networking. Grab some HootSwag for the road, share tips and make a new friend or two. Hoots to Social Sydney for hosting – more details on the [\#HootUpSydney Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/hootup/Sydney-AU/786672/).

We'll be there for sure. I personally may be a little jetlagged coming back from overseas but will be there!
