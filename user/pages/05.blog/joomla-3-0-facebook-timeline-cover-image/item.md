[![Joomla 3 logo badge](wp-content/uploads/2012/09/485663_10151105053744667_273575030_n.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151208639935862&set=a.10150720465580862.452030.152767770861&type=1&theater "Joomla 3.0 Facebook fanpage cover image photo")

Today we celebrate the release of the latest version of Joomla, Joomla 3.0. A fully mobile / responsive CMS release of the Joomla project.

A whole bunch of banners and marketing materials have been released to help others promote the release but there is one piece that was omitted, a Facebook cover image.

I took a few seconds to mock one up to allow others to share their passion for the project and help show your support.

You can download it from our Facebook fan page at <http://facebook.com/pbwebdev>.

Other marketing material can also be downloaded from the [Joomla Facebook fan page](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151103622514667.442420.6650304666&type=1) as well.

Thank you to everyone that has worked on Joomla 3.0. We look forward to getting our hands dirty playing with the latest release.
