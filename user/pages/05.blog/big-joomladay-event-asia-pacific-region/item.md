In October 2012 here in Sydney we've recently had our major event for all of us Sydney Joomla enthusiasts. Around 100 members of the Sydney Joomla community gathered together to celebrate everything and anything to do with the Joomla content management system.

The Joomla User Group Sydney pull together a few fantastic speakers from around the world in a live video stream as well as other presenters from around the country.

Early next year in Melbourne is the first JoomlaDay of 2013 in the world, (from what I could gather) and is lining up to be the biggest JoomlaDay in the history the Asia / Pacific region.

Instead of having video feeds of international guest, the organisers of JoomlaDay Melbourne have actually booked two major international Joomla specialists, [Brian Teeman](http://brian.teeman.net/ "Brian Teeman's blog"), one of the original Joomla co-founder and [Peter Van Westen](http://www.nonumber.nl/about/nonumber "Peter van Westen's profile"), a provider and master of some awesome Joomla extensions[.](http://www.nonumber.nl/about/nonumber.)

Also featuring is a stellar line up or presenters from around Australia and the Asia pacific region including [Keiran Holloway](http://melbourne.joomladay.org.au/presenters/keiran-holloway.html "Keiran Holloway profile") from Anchor hosting, [Shayne Bartlett](http://melbourne.joomladay.org.au/presenters/shayne-bartlett.html "Shayne Bartlett profile"), another of Joomla's co-founders, and [Bui Huy Thang](http://melbourne.joomladay.org.au/presenters/bui-huy-thang.html "Bui Huy Thang profile"), from the development team of JoomlaShine from Vietnam.

If you haven't had a chance to have a look at the lineup of presenters and topics make sure you check out the [MelbourneÂ JoomlaDay](http://melbourne.joomladay.org.au/program/conference-program.html "Melbourne JoomlaDay programme") website.

I'm personally am extremely excited to meet some of our international guests, some of whom I've been talking to on Twitter and Facebook for years but have never personally met! It will definitely be a highlight of the Joomla calendar here in the Asia Pacific region.

I will be at the event presenting on content construction kits again this year but this time with the component SobiPro which I absolutely love at the moment.

Hope to see you all there.
