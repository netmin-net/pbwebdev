Have you ever had a feeling its not about just plain text anymore? How easier would that be to read a book with a little bit of visual effects on it or engaging content such as what you may find on an iPad?

Have you handed your Uni assessments with just a text in it? Have you created many Facebook posts without any picture or video attached?

Engaging users in a visual medium without pictures or videos I believe is an ineffective use of the medium.

Today I was introduce to the world of infographics!

It represents a fun & quick way to learn about a topic without a tone of heavy reading.

Straight to the point , it pops up in front of you â€“ a visualisation of all the data, information and knowledge. It is a perfect way to visually communicate heavy information quickly in a creative and engaging manner.
