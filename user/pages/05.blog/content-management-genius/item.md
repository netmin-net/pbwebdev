Joomla, the word is thrown around here a lot. At first I was confused, what does it mean? What is it? I learnt that it is a content management system which enables users to create a website from scratch. After learning about how to create content on the platform, today I made my own website. I went from intern to master web developer in one day. Well, not really, but now I have my own website and I am on track to learning the ins and outs of using an open source content management system.

Using the Joomla platform is rather confusing at first. I felt slightly lost as one usually does when using new programs. To create the website I registered a domain name and applied for server space on [joomhosting.com.au](http://joomhosting.com.au "Joomla hosting Australia"). That was the easy part â€“ choosing a template from [joomlart.com](http://joomlart.com "Joomla templates") was the challenge. There is a fine line between classy templates and tacky templates, it also had to suit the site I was about to build. As a professional website for myself, I wanted to showcase a blog with various images but information about myself was also vital.

I then logged onto the backend to start building the site. Uploading the template was simple, then I was to modify the template to suit my needs. It is unbelievable how many options there are available to the user to customise the site. Half the options I did not understand and the other half I had a slight understanding of what the options meant. After a few trial and error clicks around the different options I had my website up and running, and a much clearer idea of what the different modules do.

This morning before I started on the website, I wrote a blog post for my website called Steps to Social Media Domination. This post helped me to stylise the template to suit my needs, I posted it into Joomla and uploaded it onto the site. This allowed me to see the site with real content in it and rearrange sections.

I am looking forward to using Joomla in the future and learning how to use it to its full potential. After playing around with the template options, it will become easier for me to use the system but until then I will continue my trial and error methods.
