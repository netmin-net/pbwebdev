Yay for the lightning talks at WordPress Sydney.

Thank you to all of the presenters. Shout out to Britney, Charlie!

Videos will be up soon. xoxox

Now for all of those people out there that have read this post or are reading this now and wondering what is the point of this post.

On Tuesday night I demonstrated a SEO plugin called SEO Ultimate to the WordPress Sydney meetup group. I claimed that my blog could be index and crawled by Google within an hour so we put it to the test.

The result being 3 minutes, recorded and timed by another member of the meetup group.
