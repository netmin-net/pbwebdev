Not quite, Andrew Eddie is just coming to town for a few days. While he is here we'll be running a workshop geared towards designers, Joomla implementers and template developers alike.

If you're in Adelaide and haven't attended one of Andrew's workshops before then it would be a fantastic opportunity to meet and learn from one of Joomla's best.

Also, don't forget that Andrew will also be attending the Joomla! User Group Adelaide meeting right after as well.

- Register for the [Joomla! User Group](http://www.pbwebdev.com.au/registration/) meeting.
- Book a place for Andrew's “[Introducing Designers to Joomla](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=MG4N4G8P5Z4PS)“.

### Introducing Designers to Joomla

Introducing Designers to Joomla is a short, half-day course (approximately 3.5 hours) that introduces designers to the Joomla templating system and customisation techniques.

### Course Content

This course is aimed at people who are already web savvy and have already designed static HTML page sites or dabbled with Joomla web site design. This course introduces the basic programmatic concepts behind how to build a Joomla template (but not about stylesheets and images). The following topics are covered during the session:

- The file structure of a Joomla template.
- How to include the head block, modules and the component in a Joomla template.
- An introduction to basic PHP syntax (the “if” statement) and some basic Joomla variables (getting information about the user that is logged in).
- The advantages of the output override system with respect to deploying sites for clients.
- Using layout overrides in components and modules.
- Using module chrome.
- Using pagination link overrides.

Time permitting (depending on questions), a brief introduction to designing a module and/or a brief introduction to the Joomla database schema may also be include.

### Prerequisites

No prior learning is necessarily required. However, to get the maximum benefit out of this course, you already should:

- already be familiar with HTML markup,
- know the difference between HTML and XHTML,
- be familiar with how to set up a basic Joomla web site, and
- be familiar with how to install a Joomla template

You do not need to know PHP to attend this course. You will pick up what you need to know along the way.

Bringing your own laptop is advisable in order to follow through the sample code provided.

Please note that this course does not teach you about the graphic design elements of designing a template, nor the process of cutting up designs and making the respective image and css files. Do not attend this course if you are expecting to learn how to create a Joomla template from scratch.

### When

Thursday 18th March 1pm-4:30pm

### Where

Enterprise House, Greenhill Rd, Unley

### Cost

Special price to celebrate the Adelaide trip of $220 (incl. GST – 20% off normal price of $275). Payments can via [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=MG4N4G8P5Z4PS) (directly to Andrew Eddie), direct deposit on request (use this form to make arrangements <http://www.newlifeinit.com/contact.html>), cheque or cash (no change given).
