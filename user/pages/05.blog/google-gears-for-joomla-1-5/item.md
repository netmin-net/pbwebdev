![](http://blog.phil-taylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/gear.png "Google Gears from Joomla")When working on sites from across the world, it can sometimes become extremely annoying working in the Joomla backend and waiting for the server to respond to your requests.

It could take a good few minutes for a screen to load up and in the business working environment that we live in today, it's just not good enough.

That was all a problem until stumbling across Google Gears for Joomla, available at the [Joomla Extensions directory](http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/administration/admin-add%252dons/6053/details). This just has to be the best Joomla plugin that I have come across so far this year.

I discovered the plugin after reading about Google Gears and WordPress and just wondered if there was such a solution for Joomla. One Google search later and hey presto. All of my Joomla sites now have Google Gears enables on all of them.

So, so get it working this is what you'll have to do.

Full details: <http://www.phil-taylor.com/Turbo-Gears-Speed-Up-Joomla-1.5-Admin-Console>

Just follow these instructions:

Firstly you'll need to install Google Gears on to your computer. [Google Gears](http://gears.google.com/) is available for Windows (Firefox, IE), Windows Mobile, Mac (Firefox, Safari), and Linux (Firefox)

1. Download the FREE plugin from the [Joomla Extensions directory](http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/administration/admin-add%252dons/6053/details).
2. Install it in Joomla 1.5.x Admin console the normal way for plugins
3. Select Plugin Manager from the Extensions Menu
4. Locate the “System – System – Google Gears Support” plugin
5. Publish it and WAIT 5 Seconds for a new link to appear
6. The new “Update Gears” link will appear top right next to the Preview link
7. Click the Update Gears link and follow the prompts (this is where Google Gears might need installing if you don't already have it)
8. Once the 900+ files, (usually around 1400 on my sites) are updated to gears you will be able to browse your admin console MUCH faster!!!

I've found that administering sites using Google Gears and Google Chrome can result in almost instantaneous loads for the admin pages.
