Now that the latest stable release of Joomla 1.5.17 has been fully tested on our hosting environment and on some of our client sites, PB Web Development will be going through an upgrade process across all of our sites.

![Joomla 1.5.17 upgrades](/images/stories/joomla-upgrades.png)If you're currently one of our clients and you are hosted on one of our hosting environments the your site will automatically updated to the new and latest version once it has been tested locally in our development environment. This will tie in with the server upgrades that are happening over the next few weeks.

If you're not on our hosting environment but are a current client, please put in a [request](/quote-request) to have your Joomla site upgraded to the latest version. These updates are important for the security of your Joomla based website.
