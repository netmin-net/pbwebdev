Only 1 week left before Sydney Joomla Day 2009. This time next week we'll be franticly running around doing last minute preparations for the day.

We're all looking forward to hear from the presenter line up this year. It should be a blast.

If you haven't purchased your [ticket](http://sydney.joomladay.org.au/buy-tickets "tickets for Sydney Joomla Day") yet for Sydney Joomla Day, then it is your last chance before the conference.

Hope to see you all there!
