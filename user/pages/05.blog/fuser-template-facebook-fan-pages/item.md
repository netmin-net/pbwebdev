## ![Facebook fUser Template for Joomla](http://dailyoasis.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/fbsimple.gif?w=150&h=150 "Facebook Logo")Introducing the fUser template!

If you have a Joomla powered website and Facebook Fan page, it can me sometimes time consuming to mange the content on the Facebook fan page as well as on your Joomla website. Not to mention all of the other social networks that your business might be tied into. With a little bit of configuration on a Facebook application for your website and a little more setup on your Joomla website, you can have a fully functional and feature rich Facebook fan page powered directly from your Joomla website.

fUser Template is a very simple base template that is easily customisable. It uses a common grid layout system called 520 grid from 520grid.com. Inspired by WebDesignerWall.com, the 520 template fits perfectly into the canvas area of a Facebook fan page. I have to add, that this customises the look and feel of landing pages of your Fan page.

**Demo URL**: [http://www.facebook.com/pbwebdev?sk=app\_120192334660736](http://www.facebook.com/pbwebdev?sk=app_120192334660736 "PB Web Development, Facebook landing page")

### Release Notes

- PHP 5.2.x
- 520 Grid â€“ http://www.520grid.com

### Module Positions

9 custom module positions with fully flexible widths. Switching modules on and off will dynamically assign new module widths that work with the 520 grid system.
