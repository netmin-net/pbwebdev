At PB Web Development we take many steps in regards to scoping out a project and planning for one.

There are so many different aspects to look at and test against and all should be taken into account.

Last year at the Joomla World Conference 2013 held at Harvard University, I was lucky enough to have been accepted as a presenter to talk about the website planning stages where I did a case study of how we approached the design and build of the [I Am Infusion](http://pbwebdev.com/our-work/i-am-infusion "I Am Infusion website case study") website.

Our process isn't complicated but is quite involved. As long as all the steps in the process are followed, you're guaranteed to get great measurable results.

We look at everything from branding, marketing messages, analytics, goals of the website, current conversion rates, current search engine rankings and much more.
