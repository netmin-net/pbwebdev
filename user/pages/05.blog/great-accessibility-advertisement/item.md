Our front end developer, Shannon, here in the office was working on some accessibility improvements when he stumbled upon this advertisement from the American Disability Association. I just had to share with everyone else as it seemed like a captivating and well created piece of work.

![Ad by the America Disability Association depicting an under ground staircase leading to the upper street with and overlay of Mount Everest on the gaps between the stairs. ](wp-content/uploads/2012/12/america_disability_association_stairs.jpeg)  
*For some, It's Mt Everest*  
*Help build more handicap facilities*

Did it catch you're attention? What do you think?
