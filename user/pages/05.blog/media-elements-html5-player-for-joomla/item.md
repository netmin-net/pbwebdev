![Media Elements HTML5 audio and video player](/images/2014/07/html5-audio-player-01.jpg)Media Elements HTML5 audio and video player



This is a plugin that integrate the Media Elements plugin for Joomla. It is based off the original work from the original developers of Media Elements but is no longer supported.

Since I personally love the HTML5 player and use it on our Joomla Beat Podcast website, I decided that I should release it out to the public as a free to download plugin.

There is currently no support for it until we move the extension over to our extensions website, Niche Extensions.

For now its a free to use plugin that will work with embedding audio and videos into your Joomla websites.

Please provide any feedback or improvements and we'll look at adding them into the plugin and making Media Elements for Joomla better.
