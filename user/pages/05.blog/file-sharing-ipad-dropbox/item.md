[![dropbox-150x150](wp-content/uploads/2011/08/dropbox-150x150.jpg "dropbox")](/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/dropbox.jpg)From time to time you need to share a few files with some friends or just sync a few files on your computer with your iPad. Plugging wires, setting up iTunes and working out all sorts of weird things to get it all working right can really frustrate some people. One way to get around it all is to sync it all with [DropBox](http://www.dropbox.com/ipad)!

Simply install the app on your iPad and setup what files and folders you want to sync your iPad up with and let it do the rest. It's great for situations when you're on the road and you need a few big files for a particular meeting that you're going to. One call to the office and those files can be transfered and synced to your DropBox all ready for the meeting. The only downside to it is that you have to use your mobile broadband connection and depending which provider your with that could be a problem. Otherwise, its a great alternative especially when you're on the run.
