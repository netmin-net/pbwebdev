![Joomla! CMS Versions and Support](/images/2014/07/joomla-upgrades-support.png)Image from http://docs.joomla.org/Joomla!\_CMS\_versions



As new versions of Joomla! are released the older versions become end of life.

This means that they are no longer actively supported or developed on. Developers start moving on to the later versions of the platform, third party extensions start to follow and less and less of the open source community will be actively working on the older versions.

Joomla 1.5 has an end of life product since **September 2012** and Joomla 2.5 end of life is **December 2014**.

If you're on version 1.5.x or 2.5.x then now is the perfect time to upgrade and move to the latest and greatest version of Joomla. It is easy and a straight forward process.

[Read more about Upgrading to Joomla 3](http://pbwebdev.com/blog/upgrading-your-joomla-1-5-site-to-joomla-3-x "Upgrading Your Joomla! 1.5 Site to Joomla! 3.x")

There are many benefits from upgrading to the latest version including taking advantage of new features that are packed into the latest release, new security options and more support for third party extensions to really make your Joomla! based website stand out from the rest.

Find out how we can help you upgrade your website to the latest version of Joomla.
