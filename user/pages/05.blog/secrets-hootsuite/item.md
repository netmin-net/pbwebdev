![hootesuite team management](wp-content/uploads/2012/10/hootesuite.jpg)I can't believe that I have never come across this amazingly useful social media management tool called [HootSuite](http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-6368991-10920312) Dashboard. I run my own website and social media posts but have never knew that it was possible to create, plan and schedule all the social media posts across Twitter and Facebook for a week, month or even a year in advance!

Advanced technology and innovation surrounds us and yet we are not aware of its fully dimension and its potential. I am amazed!

## Reasons to Use HootSuite

Social media platforms are way too time consuming, that is why you can save your time, and precious money spent on advertising and still be “all over the place” with your messages/posts/blogs through social campaigns.

While running your own business you can manage all of your business's social campaigns via HootSuite. All your posts & messages can be scheduled and managed all in one interface. Posts and Tweets can be published according to time/day/month that you set on the dashboard within [HootSuite](http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-6368991-10920312).

HootSuite also allows for teams to work together concurrently on multiple project. A powerful and useful combination for especially when working on so many projects.

## Pre Planning with HootSuite

Going on last minute holidays? Having a sudden wedding? Busy weekend? Not a problem, with HootSuite, you plan your social media engagement before hand and the web platforms will remain alive and vibrant while you are enjoying your holiday or focusing on your next business strategies.
