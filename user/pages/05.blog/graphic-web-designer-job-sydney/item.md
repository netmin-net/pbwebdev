In fact, we're one of the small but fast growing Sydney web design studios. The lucky candidate will be working full or part time (14 hours a week) with us at our Potts Point office.

We have a wide range of clients and you will be working with a lot of non profit organisations and high level Government agencies including, ActionAid Australia and the High Court of Australia. (Just a little name dropping)

### Daily tasks will include:

- Wireframe design
- Website designs
- Email template designs
- Banner and logo development
- Corporate branding development

We'll be teaching our new web and graphic designer the principals behind user interface design, designing websites where you don't have to think and industry practises when it comes to designing and developing print and corporate branding.

### Required Knowledge

- Graphic design programmes including, Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign
- Visual communication skills

There will be good possibilities of an on going position when you have finished your studies. Get ready to be thrown into the deep end and start learning quick!
