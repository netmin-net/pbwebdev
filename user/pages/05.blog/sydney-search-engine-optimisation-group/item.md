[![SEO Process](wp-content/uploads/2011/04/process-seo-150x150.png "SEO Process")](wp-content/uploads/2011/04/process-seo.png)For any website, search engine optimization is key for a websites long term success. The Sydney search engine optimization Meetup group, gathers at least once a month to help each other with their search engine optimization goals and hopefully share a little bit of information as well.

In most situations, search engine optimization experts tend to keep their SEO secrets to themselves, but in this friendly atmosphere, with a few drinks, we hope to learn from each other.
