[![Droomla - Joomla + Drupal Logo](/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/droomla-logo-new.png "droomla-logo-new")](/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/droomla-logo-new.png)Deep in the northern edge of the United States in a little place called Battle Creek, we find the mad ‘scientists' or programmers, experimenting on the unzipped remains of Joomla and Drupal. Working away in the dark damp bowels of Battle Creek, these crazy programmers have created and hatched a diabolical beast they call ‘Droomla!' Just like how Frankenstein was created so has Droomla. Sound fictitious? On the contrary, this monster is 100% real.

I usually don't have have much time to review components and blog about them lately but this freakishly new frankenstein creation from the group at ‘[corePHP](http://www.corephp.com/ "corePHP website")‘ has caught my attention from Twitter. Imagine combining two of the most popular content management systems out on the market.

One with a power access control, content versioning and content taxonomy and the other CMS with easy management and templating control and WOW you get Droomla. A CMS with all the bells and whistles but also easy to use.

## The Benefits of Droomla

Now that you can use both of the content management systems together you can take advantage of all of the features that in both of the CMSs. Where one CMS lacks in features of functionality the other now makes up for it.

For a full list of features and benefits from both of the CMSs its best to look at the demo site from corePHP: [http://droomla.corephpdemos.com](http://droomla.corephpdemos.com "Droomla Demo site") (I also noticed that they're using the T3 Framework, nice!)

Here at PB Web Development we've been using content construction kits, such as K2 and Zoo 2.0 for Joomla, to extend its content functionality which has worked great for us as it has really extended the core Joomla content construction but is still limited. One other huge benefit of the bridge is that now we have access to over 6000 Joomla extensions and over 5500 Drupal modules.

That's a huge repository of predeveloped functionality and from a developer and implementors point of view, a dream.

## The Downsides of Droomla

If anyone does decide to use Droomla, there will be a lot more administration and maintenance but that is to be expected when you're using Joomla, Drupal and a bridge. So now as web administrators, you'll have to maintain all three distributions and secure them all. A little bit more work but I believe the benefits out weigh the cost of maintaining the monster.

The other downside I see if the future developments of both Joomla 1.6 -> Joomla 1.7 and development of Drupal 7 and onwards. How will these future releases of Joomla and Drupal affect Droomla and how are the [corePHP](http://www.corephp.com/ "corePHP website")guys going to support the Droomla bridge for the future builds? I personally do not like leaving a website without an upgrade path of some sort for future upgrades and patches of Joomla or Drupal.

## An Update and Response from corePHP

After writing this article and publishing it, Adam Stephen Docherty from corePHP, responded to some of the concerns and downsides there were to using Joomla, Drupal and Droomla.

*“We are committed to keeping the Drupal distribution housed inside of Droomla updated inline with updates from Drupal. The great thing about this is the fact that a Droomla user will only have to download the latest Droomla release and upload like they do any other Joomla! component, basically a one click update for the Drupal distribution.*

***This in it's self is a huge boon for those of us less technically inclined due to the fact that upgrading Drupal can seem quite involved as per:* [*http://drupal.org/upgrade*](http://drupal.org/upgrade) *Droomla will take care of all the nitty gritties of upgrading allowing the site admin to concentrate on more important things like writing about “mad scientists” and “dark, dank caves”! *

*Kidding… but seriously it is nice to be able to Browse->Upload and all is done!”*

Adam also addressed some of the security issues that may be of concern with using both the platforms and the bridge.

*“In regards to security, Droomla is secure as Joomla and Drupal, we have not hacked in anyway the authentication / session systems of either platform, in fact we have not hacked the Drupal codebase at all, save for a slight change to the index.php file to allow us to control Drupal theme selection and a few other things, all such being in line with Drupal API guidelines.”*

Lastly the future of the platforms and the bridge is also addressed:

*“We are also very aware that Drupal and Joomla are at a cross roads at this time, both with pending major releases in versions 7 and 1.6 respectively. **We are committed to making this transition as painless as possible for our clients and will automate as much as possible in this area.* *As a company our primary service is in deploying and supporting GPL based software. This is our day job so to speak and we are committed to backing our cliental 100%. We offer prompt support and the peace of mind in knowing that one has the full backing of professionals when the mission gets critical. This goes for Droomla and the rest of our products as well.”*

**You can read the full response from Adam in the comments of this blog post. Thank you for your comments Adam.

## Download

Droomla can be accessed from the [corePHP](http://www.corephp.com/joomla-products/droomla.html "Droomla home page") website for a small fee.

## Quick Installation Video and Overview

## What Else?

Now that that there is this integration between Drupal and Joomla, what about Joomla and WordPress? Well, that one already exists! So now you can potentially install Drupal, Joomla and WordPress all together. It's called DroomlaPress and completely insane. An extremely powerful CMS with a complex ACL, taxonomy, easy administration and crazy search engine optimisation powers. Thats my kinda of CMS.
