We we're implementing some Facebook like boxes for a few clients at have noticed that Facebook has stooped to a new low using rude and offensive language in their like boxes now.

I've never seen anything like this before from Facebook. The behaviour is quite strange and completely unacceptable. In the screenshot that was taken, you can clearly see the letters “FU” with the Facebook logo.

What are people going to think!?
