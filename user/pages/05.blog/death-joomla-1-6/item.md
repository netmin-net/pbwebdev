![Joomla 1.7](wp-content/uploads/2011/08/version-17.png "Joomla 1.7")Today marks the day when Joomla 1.6 is no longer supported for patches and updates by the Joomla team.

This doesn't mean that your Joomla site will no longer work but rather it is time to upgrade to Joomla 1.7.

The Joomla projects new faster release development plan for Joomla has seen many changes over the last 8 months since the first initial release of Joomla 1.6 back in January. Furthermore the latest release will soon reach end of life when Joomla 1.8 is release early next year in January 2012.

## Short Release Cycles

This shorter and faster release cycle for Joomla means that there is more active development on the project and more features are pushed into the system rather than the overly long life of Joomla 1.5.

The long life of the CMS limited new features being implemented into the system and thus frameworks started appearing for Joomla 1.5 as it didn't do everything that developers wanted it to do.

## Time To Upgrade

So if you have a website running Joomla 1.6 then it should be a good time to upgrade to Joomla 1.7. All the major extensions should be all ready for Joomla 1.7 by now as well. Thats if they were already Joomla 1.6 compatible.

If you're building a new website it is also recommended that you start looking at building it in Joomla 1.7 rather than Joomla 1.5 or Joomla 1.6 but this all depends on the extensions that you may be using for your build.
