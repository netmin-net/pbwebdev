![JoomlaDay Sydney 2012](wp-content/uploads/2012/10/joomla-day-sydney-2012.png)After another JoomlaDay here in Sydney I've taken a little time out to write a blog post about the day and what I got out of the day. From the food, the people, the networking, presentations and workshops there was a little something for everyone. We were even lucky enough to have a fireworks show on Darling Habour on Saturday night. Connecting with the passionate Joomla community here in Australia is definately a highlight of the weekend.

More photos of the event can be seen on our [Facebook fan page](http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151239960125862.509611.152767770861&type=1 "PB Web Development's Facebook fan page").

## What I Wanted From JoomlaDay Sydney 2012

![Jen Kramer Joomla day Sydney](wp-content/uploads/2012/10/jen-kramer-joomla-day-sydney.jpg)*Jen Kramer's video presentation and live Q and A at Joomla Day Sydney 2012*What I wanted foremost from JoomlaDay Sydney was to meet new people and to meet others that I only knew from Twitter and the digital space. Meeting certain people from around Australia and the world was a key highlight for myself and I only manage to meet a fraction of the people I intended to as well. It was a pleasure to finally meet Anthony from JoomlaBamboo and the team from StackIdeas.

## My Conference Highlights

It was a long and amazing day but there were a few highlights that I really enjoyed. Unfortunately as I was helping out during the day checking people into the conference I did miss a few of the presentations but the ones that I did see were well worth it.

### Joomla Day Sydney Presentation Highlights

“Performance Stacks” presented by Shayne Bartlett, “7 Extensions to Install Before You Die” presented by Danielle Breckon and “Why Developers Hate Sysadmins” presented by Kieran Holloway from Anchor Hosting.

I missed Jen's, Kyle's and also Phil's presentations about Joomla 3.0 and Twitter Bootstrap. Somewhat annoying to have missed them but hope to see all the videos soon.

### Hanging out with the StackIdeas Guys

On Sunday I spent most of the day rolling out site updates and changes to a few Joomla client websites but after that was done I managed to get out on the water on a tall ship cruise with the visiting team from StackIdeas.
