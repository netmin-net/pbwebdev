Unlike some other people and companies, we've only started looking at developing websites in Joomla 1.6. (Shock horror!!) The main reason for waiting if because of the list of extensions that we can't live without aren't stable yet for Joomla 1.6 and thus we can't most to the new platform as yet.

So without these components and plugins it looks like we can't start developing websites in the new platform.

There is hope though. A little in investigation yesterday afternoon lead to the discovery of a few of those plugins getting closer to a stable release, or infact, Joomla 1.6 versions all together.

One of the main ones that we use is JoomlaWork's K2. I was quite happy to find out that K2 will be ported over to Joomla 1.6 when they release version 2.6 to coincide with the Joomla and Beyond conference in May this year.

I can't wait to see what they have in the goodies list for the new version with Joomla 1.6. It will make web design and development a joy for sure.

One important feature that I'm crossing my fingers for is the easier migration from Joomla 1.5 + K2 to Joomla 1.6 + K2. since K2 resides in its own database tables, and very simple ones at that, I'm hoping that the migration process will be as smooth as possible.

Other components that we use and we can slowly being upgraded to the latest versions of Joomla include:

- JCE, one of the favourite Joomla content editors out there to date. With rich media capabilities and controls, this is a hard one for use to develop without.
- Forms component, either RSForms or Breezing Forms. RSForms is the main forms component that we use to date but with the development of Breezing Forms and its very nice accessible output of form code, I think we'll be developing website with that instead.
- RSFirewall, this one was one of the very first components that was ported over to Joomla 1.6 and went straight onto our Joomla 1.6 development websites as soon as it could.

Search engine friendly URLs are still a problem at this point in time. Most of us prefer the SEF URLs to not have the article ID numbers inserted into the URLs, of course without them there can be duplicate URL issues that will cause problems for Joomla but converting hour current sites that don't have article id numbers in the URL to ones that do will hamper SEO rankings for many of our websites.

A little investigation into the current SEF URL components out there now and only one is available for Joomla 1.6. It is free but it will also insert link back URL to the author website. I'd gladly pay a small fee to get a version that removes the link backs even if the component isn't stable. Its a step closer to use actually using Joomla 1.6.

Once those final check lists are sorted out, we'll be looking at developing a list of new websites with high levels of access control, workspaces and some other interesting organisational structured websites for Government and corporate clients.

Keep developing guys for Joomla 1.6!
