Happy New Year everyone! We all hope that everyone has had a good New Years break and Christmas as well. We had a great 2012 and we're really looking forward to what we have planned here for 2013. We've decided not to have any New Year's resolutions but instead to set some awesome goals instead. Here is a little sneak peak into what we're up to this year and some of the goals that we've set for ourselves. Lets see how we go.

## Goal 1: Launch the Joomla Beat Podcast

I've personally been playing around with the idea of launching a podcast about Joomla for almost a year. Recently in late 2012 I got invited to be a co-host on a digital radio station called Eagle Waves Radio and I was pretty much hooked. You can check out what we've been doing on the radio station at Eagle Waves Radio. [http://eaglewavesradio.com.au/category/shows/web-eagle/](http://eaglewavesradio.com.au/category/shows/web-eagle/ "Web Eagles radio show on Eagle Waves Radio")

So this year we've started our own little podcast show here in the office called Joomla Beat Podcast. I have no idea why I called it Joomla Beat. It was the first thing that came to me so I'm sure it's going to stick now. I'll be recording the last part of the first show tonight and getting it online tonight! You can find out more about the podcast at [http://pbwebdev.com/podcast/](podcast/ "PB Web Development's podcast: Joomla Beat Podcast")

**Our goal:** is to get 100,000 downloads of the podcasts episodes but the end of 2013! I think it's possible.

## Goal 2: Write an ebook

This is also something that I've been playing with late 2012 and over the break I took some time out to myself and started writing the outline to a Joomla manual / book on how to market and manage your Joomla site. I should have this project wrapped up in a few months as I've already started blazing through the first few chapters!

This is an outline of what is in the book so far. I don't believe this will change much as I finish writing it.

- Introduction
- Foreword
- Security
- Backups
- Extending Joomla
- Blogging and Content
- Social Media
- Search Engine Optimisation
- Web Accessibility
- Joomla Performance
- Hosting
- Site Maintenance
- Building Communities
- Pay Per Click Advertising
- Monetisation

You'll be able to download it as an ebook as a PDF, from the Apple iBook store or as an epub for your Amazon ebook readers. Furthermore, we're making the PDF fully accessible so it can be read with a screen reader. We've been doing a lot of work with accessible PDFs lately and we might as well keep things up and make all of our own work fully accessible as well.

**Our goal:** I'd be really happy with 50,000 downloads of the digital ebook by the end of 2013 whether it is used as a resource for managing and marketing your Joomla website or as an example of how you can make a fully accessible designed ebook.

## Goal 3: The Joomla News YouTube Channel

This is another project that we're going to produce and launch this year as well. We're setting up a stage production for this so it is going to take a little longer to set up but is another thing we're adding to the goals list.

**Our goal:** just to get it up and running! It is a bit more of a cost for everything so it is going to take a bit more time and more effort.

## Goal 4: Launch Our Extension Shop

We've been building custom extensions for a long time now but we have never made any of them public. It is about time that we do and some of these extensions are pretty handy. We shouldn't hog them all to ourselves. We're already in the process of setting it up and hope to have this one up by the end of the month. It's called Niche Extensions and you can already go to the site to get and idea of what its all about. They're all very small specific extensions for key tasks that we've found necessary over the years for all of our websites. Check out what we've got going on so far at [http://nicheextensions.com/](http://nicheextensions.com "Niche Extensions for Joomla")

## Goal 5: Provide More Joomla Training Sessions

A part of one of our services here at PB Web Development is training in Joomla. We use to provide a free monthly training session here at PB Web Development but we had to stop as we all got so busy here. This year we'd like to kick it off again and stick to more of a rigid schedule which will allow attendees the ability to sign up, and plan sessions they may wish to attend. You can see some of our sessions that we've already got planned at [http://joomtraining.com.au](http://joomtraining.com.au "Joomla Training Australia")

**Our goal:** to grow the training sessions from free monthly sessions to a free and paid training day that will allow users to come in and really evaluate what Joomla can do for them and their businesses.

So 5 goals and what seems to be 5 very big goals as well. There is a lot of work there to play around with but I think we have it in use here to hit these goals this year.

We're really looking forward to everything that we have planned as well as all the great client projects that we're also working with. It will be interesting to look back at this post at the end of 2013 and see just how many of these goals we actually hit.
