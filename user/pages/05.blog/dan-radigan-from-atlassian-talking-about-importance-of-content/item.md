[![Dan Radigan at WordPress Sydney Meetup](/images/2014/02/dan-radigan.jpg)](/images/2014/02/dan-radigan.jpg)Dan Radigan presenting at WordPress Sydney Meetup on Content



Dan Radigan from Atlassian joins the WordPress Sydney meetup to talk about the importance of content no matter where you are in the stage if your website.

The sooner you know and understand your users and audience that read your content, the better you can engage your them.

Dan breaks down his process that he and his team uses at Atlassian to help promote and market their products into three steps.

- **Create**
- **Communicate**
- **Evaluate**

## **Create**

Content providers need to bring useful and consistent content to their audience.

Within Atlassian, as an author writes a piece of content, it is drafted within the internal systems on Confluence and distributed within the organisation for feedback. Having familiar layouts and presentation style that is visually similar, if not the same, to the way the content will be presented helps the review and editing process.

The collaboration and feedback on the content that is being written needs to be as close to the final presentation of the content as possible.

Making sure that all of the content is cleaned with no excess formatting and clean HTML with text and images also helps with the internal Atlassian processes to publish the content online with WordPress. Internally all of the content is drafted on Confluence and then manually migrated over to WordPress for scheduled posting and publishing.

## **Communicate**

Not all content is created equal. Not all content is important as others and there are layers to the content as it rolls out. Content is also time sensitive but all content will become more and more irrelevant over time. Hence it is important to know your market and audience so you can get the best results.

As author group grows internally, curators manage the content and publishing workflow. Scheduling of the content becomes important at this stage as well.

The user roles within WordPress helps with these situations and controls how people and authors publish online. All of the publishing rights should be controlled this way.

When you look at a blog or website home page, the first piece of content is always the most important.

All the authors of the website fight for this positioning and this is also where control is needed. The people with the right publishing roles will be able to position the articles in the right place on the website. Only the right articles should be placed in the prime positioning.

 

## **Evaluate**

How so you know you're doing the right thing. Content is constantly changing. What gets the most traffic and grow with that.

Dan recommends to do it with Google Analytics to see what content is good! Looking at some of the key metrics to learn about the audience and ind out who you're talking to and how you can engage with them.

You can find out what browser type your audience is using, e.g is IE 8 important to your audience. Are mobile users important what type of devices are they using. Is the audience all on android devices or are they using iOS devices. All this helps with publishing and curating of the content.

With the analytics you can see what type if traffic is coming in from social media and what is coming in via organic search. You will be able to determine how users are coming to the website and even determine what social media networks they are using to maximise your efforts in regards to social media engagement.

**Optimize the keyword**

This is the primary dimensions of a page to find out how people get to that content. It can determine how you lay it out and how you structure your content.

**Validate your architecture**

Google analytics will tell you how they are walking through a website. Find out how they navigate and see if it is effective.

**Visitor flow**

When is my audience online and when is it best to engage with them.

Within Google Analytics you can customize and create a custom report and break it down to hours of a day so you as a content publisher knows when it is best to publish for your audience.

**Segments**

Segments in Google Analytics is extremely powerful. You can engage the audience with a call to action, a sign up referral and track that metric.

You can analyse these metrics to find out what made people click, was it hour of day, was it the website the referral came from?What ever the metric, it can be determined so you can apply the same thing again and get the most out of it.

UTM codes are important and help tracking these campaigns. Google provides a [UTM URL building tool](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033867?hl=en "Google UTM URL building tool") that helps you create these unique tracking URLs to help you better track and segment your traffic and analyse marketing campaigns and how to best engagement with your audience.

 

## Review

Following these outlines that Dan has mentioned will help you with creating content, creating engaging content and hopefully help build your brand and website.

You can follow [Dan on Twitter](https://twitter.com/danradigan "Dan Radigan") and I'm sure he'll drop by and answer any questions readers may have about content, publishing and workflow at Atlassian.
