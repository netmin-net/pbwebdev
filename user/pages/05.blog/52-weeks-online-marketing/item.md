PB Web Development will be putting a week by week guide to marketing products and websites online.

Each week we'll be posting a new step by step guide on a different online marketing technique to help improve your website's traffic, conversions and search engine rankings.

We'll be using a example site and build it from the ground up using all of the techniques and guides that we present in this series. So not only will you get a step by step guide but also a working case study to base your own site against to see what really works and what doesn't.

We'll be covering topics from email marketing, web analytics, pay per click advertising, search engine optimisation, blogging, the mobile web and social network marketing.

So make sure you subscribe to the feed and put in to practise all of these methods and techniques to help improve and add to your online marketing strategies.

## About the Case Study Site

The case study site that will be built up over the 52 week period will be a a fresh site that hasn't even been registered yet. In fact, we haven't even decided what it will be at all.

Either way, you will get a fantastic overview of how to build a websites traffic levels up from nothing.
