![Push to Live](wp-content/uploads/2011/06/push-to-live.png "Push to Live for Joomla")Over the past few months we've been perfecting a little system on our websites called “**Push to Live**“. It allow our clients to work safely on a secure staging environment that is only accessible to the administrators and users within the organisation.

From within this safe environment, web administrators can then simply click a button to push tested and approved content from the staging server to a live server, hence the name “**Push to Live**“.

## Why Do We Need This?

For many of our corporate and Government clients this process is needed as internal workflows within their organisations require content to be approved through several levels before information can be distributed and made public. The process of publishing an article from a staging server to a live server is quite simple.

From the staging server, the user simply needs to navigate to the article that they want published from the article manager and click on the icon for “**Push to Live**“.

Instructions and prompts will appear allowing the content to be push to the live server.

This works for Joomla articles and file assets that the user name have uploaded to the staging website.

## Benefits

1. Private and secure environment to test and have content approved via internal workflow process without the need of usernames and passwords.
2. Secure live environment that isn't used for anything but reading from a database and displaying content to the public.
3. File transfer and file publishing from staging to live servers.

Videos of the system coming soon.
