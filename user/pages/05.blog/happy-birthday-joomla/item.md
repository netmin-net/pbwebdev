![Joomla's 5th Birthday](wp-content/uploads/2010/08/happy-bday-joomla.jpg "Happy Birthday Joomla")Oh how could I forget! Upon waking up this morning and reading through my regular blog posts I see one in particular from the Joomla.org website in regards to Joomla and Joomla.org turning 5 today. Joomla today celebrates 5 years of existence as the 1st of September marks the day the Joomla.org website was launched.

I must thank Joomla, the developers and all of the community because we as a business may not even exist or be doing as well as we are right now.

We'll always be supporting Joomla, Joomla Days around Australia and Joomla User Group meetings where ever possible.
