So with all of the celebrations around the world for Joomla's 5th birthday, we thought we'd add in our pictures of our little celebration here in the Sydney web design office.

  
  
 Thank you Joomla everyone in the community. We wouldn't be where we are now if it wasn't for such a great community.
