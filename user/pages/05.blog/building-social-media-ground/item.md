![Setting up social networks for engagement](wp-content/uploads/2012/11/setting-up-social-networks-for-engagement.jpg)Setting up a social media network for a client, sounds fairly simple? Not really, I guess most people would assume that all you need to do is create a Facebook page, a Twitter account and you're good to go. Wrong! Do I possess the ability to create a social media network for a client from the ground up?

If someone has asked me that 5 weeks ago, I would have said yes, oh how naïve I was! Yes I could have done it, but would it have been beneficially sound for the client? Probably not.

## Why Social Media?

Social media is a staple in 2012 for businesses and people alike. It is rare that you will meet someone who does not have either a Facebook account, a Twitter account or at the very least a LinkedIn account, even my grandma has a Facebook account (although I think she got scared about using it after attending a “cyber bullying” talk at the local community centre).

If a business does not involve itself in any form of social media there is potentially this giant gap for servicing and engaging their desired target market.

## A few tips on creating a solid social media network for a client

Firstly you do not want to leave out any key information in the about and information sections of each network. Such as with Facebook, it is vital to have contact details for the client available and a link to the clients website. Another way you can incorporate this is into a Twitter background image, for example in Photoshop I designed a background for a client and included the website address. If a viewer was to be interested in finding out more information they could easily find it.

Which brings me to my next point, background images and cover photos are vital to a social media page as they create a visually appealing aspect to the page. It also allows the viewer a little insight into what the page is about. Who wants to visit a Facebook page with no cover image? Boring. It is important to have images which relate to the page content, remembering to include the clients colour palette, which allows for a memorable link between client and their social networking page. It is of interest to note that it is beneficial to use the same image as the profile image across all networks such as Google +, Facebook and Twitter. This allows for the viewers to create a visual connection between accounts.

The main idea of social media is to create a network for the client, bringing together a range of people and other companies which have similar interests to the content of the client. So you have no idea about the industry of the client? Don't just follow every account you see, otherwise the collective newsfeeds will end up full of useless information to the client. For example, a client which sells water bottles would unlikely to be interested in web designer extensions. Instead, they could be interested in following pages on a variety of sports or healthy eating.

Maintaining a steady and consistent update of content over the multitude of social media platforms will enable a sound network for the client. Social media sites enable people to fuel their innate desire to share and communicate so it is vital to create a solid base for the client.

Building the platforms are just the first steps in creating social platforms for the clients. The final goal after setting up a base is to create an engaging online community where user interact with the business and brand.
