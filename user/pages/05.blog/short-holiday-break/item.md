![Maui](wp-content/uploads/2011/04/maui_img-150x150.jpg "Maui")Did I mention we're going on a short holiday in May? Well some of us in the office will be away so there will be limited resources during that time.

If your one of our hosted solution or service clients, please arrange backups of your websites in early May to be either emailed or delivered to you.

Please refrain from breaking your website during this period ![:)](https://pbwebdev.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png) we know it's always tempting. Most of our clients shouldn't even realize that we are gone during this time as all project time lines have this period taken into account.

10 points and a gold star if you can guess where we're going!
