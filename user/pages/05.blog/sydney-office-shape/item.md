Office furniture comes in this week and hopefully power and internet will come soon after.

If you're in the area, please pop in and say hi and see how we are progressing.

We'll be running all of our client training and web design and development work from this office, so we're making it like home.

For more information about [**training sessions**](http://www.joomtraining.com.au/sessions/ "Joomla Training Sessions"), please see **[JoomTraining.com.au](http://www.joomtraining.com.au "Joomla Training")**

We're also in the process of looking for a intern or a trainee to start working at our office for general design and web management. So if you've just arrived from overseas, or finished tertiary studies and looking for some experience, please [contact us](http://www.pbwebdev.com.au/contact-us.html "Contact PB Web Development") if you are interested.
