We just got some very good news.

The High Court of Australia website that we launched earlier this year got nominated for a JOSCAR at J and Beyond. Fingers crossed and well see who wins the awards this year.

We're up against:

- [http://www.europeandemocracy.org](http://www.europeandemocracy.org/)
- <http://www.guggenheim.org/>
- <http://www.unric.org/>

In our category for non profit website.
