![20111011-184944.jpg](wp-content/uploads/2011/10/20111011-184944.jpg)This week at the Sydney Joomla User group we had a bit more of an open meeting where the members of the meet up get more of an opportunity to stand and contribute to the meet up with questions and answers.

This would have been the perfect session for anyone who is a beginner in Joomla.

Ian, Bruce, Karl, Mahesh and a few mini lightning presentations tonight about a few great topics, extensions and website builds.

Ian Scott gave a great presentation on a few extensions from NoNumbers. They aren't big or huge extensions just really small and simple extensions that makes your life just that little bit easier.

- NoNumber module anywhere
- NoNumber article anywhere
- NoNumber add to menu (I really like this one)
- NoNumber clear cache (this one looks awesome too)
- NoNumber extension manager (quick and easy way of installing all the NoNumber extensions)

Bruce gave a quick little presentation on a website rebuild that he did for a client that had a big genealogy website that he had to rebuild. With over 400 articles and a complex layer of links and slice images he put together a professional website using a customized template from Gavick.

Karl from Cute Gecko presented on a nifty Joomla tool by Joomla R Us called SQL to excel. This was a nifty little tool to export database data from Joomla To Excel. Perfect for reporting sales and stock from Virtuemart or statistics from your Joomla website.

Mahesh, gave a little presentation on extensions used for a website build that he did called carercareers.com.au. The website was originally built in a Microsoft based CMS and is being rebuilt in Joomla. Joommailer was used to integrate in Mail Chimp. Another great component that Mahesh mentioned was multi category which allows an article to be placed into multiple categories.
