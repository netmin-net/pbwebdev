![WordPress iOS](wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-07-at-2.05.22-PM-150x150.png "WordPress iOS")As I sit here at my local Vietnamese take away place, I suddenly found a massive desire and urge to write a blog post. Yes it's quite strange, but you might as well be a little productive while waiting for food.

Having this blog built in WordPress has a few advantages, namely this awesome iPhone app that allows me to post directly to my WordPress blog anywhere I have a mobile connection. Very handy if your traveling around a lot and your livelihood depends on blogging. Other advantages include a whole list of automation but we'll go through that another time.

The WordPress for iOS app allows you to write new posts, pages, manage existing pages and post, and even manage your comments on your WordPress website.

If you have a iPhone and are a constantly blogger I highly recommend it. ![:)](https://pbwebdev.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png)

You can download the app via the Apps store. Visit [http://ios.wordpress.org/](http://ios.wordpress.org/ "iOS or WordPress") for more information and screenshots of the application in action.

Did I mention it works on the iPads too?

I'm excited! Now to find the equivalent for Joomla and K2.
