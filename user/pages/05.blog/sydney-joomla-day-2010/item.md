Since the cancellation of the Joomla World Conference earlier this year, there is now space in the calendar for the Sydney Joomla User Group to organise the local event for the City of Sydney.

So far the talk is to have the event on the same weekend the Joomla World Conference which was suppose to be held on the 6th and 7th of November.

The venue should be organised very soon as well as the line up of speakers and potential workshops.
