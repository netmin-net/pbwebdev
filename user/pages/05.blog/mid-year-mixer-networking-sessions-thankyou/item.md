![meetup](wp-content/uploads/2012/06/meetup.jpg)Wow, what an outstanding turnout on Tuesday for the Mid Year Mixer. I do think we hit the 150 mark in the room.

It was great to see all the Meetup and user groups getting together and mixing it all up.

I didn't get to take ANY photos! I usually run around and take a ridiculous amount but I just didn't get a chance to last night. If you've taken any photos on the night please Tweet them to me [@astroboysoup](http://twitter.com/astroboysoup) or go old school and email them to me, [peter@pbwebdev.com.au](mailto:peter@pbwebdev.com.au). I'll be passing them on to all the groups for use in social media.

Thank you to the Product Maven girls for helping me out too. It's been great brainstorming ideas and building connections and getting the finer details done. It's always a pleasure working with you all. Big special thanks to [Melanie](https://twitter.com/#!/melaniehoole) as well for working the registrations last night and [Alana](https://twitter.com/#!/aussiegoldy) as well!

Thank you to our sponsors!
