It's awards season again and this year we're going to enter the professional services category of the Sydney Business Awards 2012.

We appreciate all of the support from our clients and the open source communities that we help and worked with over the last year.

Please feel free to [vote for us](https://www.sydneybusinessawards.com.au/vote/cast/239 "Vote for us") at the Sydney Business Awards website or via **SMS** by **texting PBWEB to 0498 500 100**.

All votes go into a **$1500 cash draw**! So there are benefits for all for voting!

Thanks everyone who has voted. We look forward to growing together further in the future.
