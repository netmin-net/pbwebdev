Last month's WordPress meetup was all about e-commerce, what you should be looking at when starting an e-commerce project, an overview of some popular e-commerce plugins for WordPress and also a more indepth look into the Shopp e-commerce plugin for WordPress.

Thank you to Dee for giving the group a well rounded [overview of the e-commerce environment for WordPress](http://thewebprincess.com/getting-to-grips-with-e-commerce "overview of e-commerce for WordPress").

My slides which looked into the Shopp plugin can be found on slide share.
