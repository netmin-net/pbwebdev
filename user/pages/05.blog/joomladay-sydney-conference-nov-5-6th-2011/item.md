![JoomlaDay Sydney 2011 Logo](http://joomla.org.au/images/stories/sydney/Joomlday-sydney-logo-2011.png "JoomlaDay Sydney 2011 - Nov 5th-6th")With just under a month to go the Sydney Joomla User Group (SJUG) is proud to present the only Joomla! conference to be held in Australia for 2011, Sydney JoomlaDay 2011, on **Sat 5 & Sun 6 Nov 2011**, at the **University of Technology Sydney** – City campus 15 Broadway, Ultimo, NSW 2007.

We're all looking forward to all the guests and presenters from overseas and from around Australia at what is looking at being a fantastic weekend for all Joomla enthusiasts involved.

Whether you're a business owner that uses Joomla, a website implementer or developer, this day is well worth coming along to as you will be able to meet, network and learn from other business owners, programmers and designers that all use the Joomla content management system.

With a fantastic lineup of well renowned presenters from around the world and Australia and workshops run by experienced Joomla specialists, it is looking to be one of the best Joomla!Days yet.

The conference is spread over two days, one day full of presentations ending with a social event and the second with detailed workshops for those that want to get their hands dirty and have a hands on approach to learning about Joomla.

I, Peter Bui, will be presenting two presentations on the day. One on the “K2 component” by JoomlaWorks and the other on “Contributing to the Joomla Community”.

The full conference and workshop program, ticket pricing and purchasing via PayPal are available online from: <http://sydney.joomladay.org.au/>
