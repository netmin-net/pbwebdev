![Twitter Cashing In](wp-content/uploads/2010/02/twitter-cash1.jpg "Twitter Cashing In")

So there are whispers in the industry at the moment about Twitter releasing their Google inspired advertising platform on their network. The hugely popular micro blogging network is finally capitalizing on their work. According to reports from All Things Digital, the ads will appear on the search results on Twitter. So when ever a user searches Twitter for particular keywords.

Lots of details haven't been finalised as yet such as:

- How are ads bought and placed.
- Will Twitter search become more refined and become more useful to users.
- How will Twitter gather more information on its users to provide more accurate results.

What I'd love to see is that ads appearing through their API and for publishers to be able to also capitalise on the Twitter ads. This would mean that the ads will start appearing on all of the Twitter applications, mobile devices and other Twitter platforms. The advertising reach that advertisers will be able to have will be amazing. Advertising being directed straight to a users mobile device.

More information is yet to be released but we'll be watching this one carefully.
