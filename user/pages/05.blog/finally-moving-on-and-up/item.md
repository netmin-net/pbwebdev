Just over two years ago we had a very strong presence in Adelaide where we provided web design and web development services for our clients there.

Since then PB Web Development has moved on and moved over to Sydney where we've found a new family of clients and websites to work on. We're not dropping all of our Adelaide clients altogether though. We still have a strong working relationship with them and will still be working and maintaining existing Adelaide clients.

You've been good to us Adelaide but Sydney now officially is our home. Wonder what is happening in Melbourne and Brisbane?
