At our last Sydney Joomla User Group meeting in June, the group held a little think tank for the up coming Sydney JoomlaDay conference 2011.

Of course we're all excited to have a conference this year as last year Sydney didn't get to have one.

Date of the conference will be Saturday and Sunday, 5-6th of November 2011.

Location: University of Technology Sydney â€“ City campus 15 Broadway, Ultimo, NSW 2007
