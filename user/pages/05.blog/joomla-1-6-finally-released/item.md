After several months of long hard work by the Joomla development team, the latest major version of Joomla has finally been release. Joomla 1.6 starts a new era of Joomla websites for all designers, developers and website administrators.

You can [download the new release](http://joomlacode.org/gf/project/joomla/frs/?action=FrsReleaseBrowse&frs_package_id=5696 "Download Joomla 1.6") from the Joomla.org website, view the [demo site of Joomla 1.6](http://demo.joomla.org/ "Joomla 1.6 demo site"), and read a few [Joomla 1.6 tutorials](http://joomtraining.com.au/tutorials/joomla-1.6/ "Joomla 1.6 tutorials").

Drupal had its launch date last week on the 7th of January and WordPress are looking at the release of WordPress 3.1 at the end of this month. It is quite a busy month for the entire open source community.

With the release of Joomla 1.6 we see a huge list of changes to the framework, and administrator side of the system as well as visual changes with the distribution of new default templates with Joomla 1.6.

## ![Article Manager](wp-content/uploads/2011/01/article-manager.jpg "Article Manager")

## List of New Changes and Features in Joomla 1.6

Here is just a snap shot of some of the new features and changes that feature in Joomla 1.6.

### New Admin Control Buttons, Save & New, Save & Close

This feature is very similar to that of how the K2 content construction kit currently works in Joomla 1.5. This new Save & New and Save & Close allows users to quickly add lots of content to a website without having to close the newly saved article and then clicking on NEW again to create another article.

### Featured Articles Instead of FrontPage articles

Featured articles now replaces front page articles as it is recognised that not all articles are necessarily published to a â€˜front page' of a site. Featured articles maybe listed in a submenu area or nested deeper in a category structure.

### Module Assignment

In Joomla 1.5 we saw the ability to assign modules to any menu item in the system. Now in Joomla 1.6 we have the option to assign modules to all menu items except for the ones that we select. This is the reverse of what is currently available and gives administrators much more flexibility over how they can assign modules in the system.

### Session Expiration

Session expiration in Joomla is important for security. In Joomla 1.5 we saw users being redirected back to the main administrator control panel once they login again. Now in Joomla 1.6, when you log-in again after your session expires you are taken back to the previous screen that you were on. Another great usability improvement.

### Media Manager Enhancements

![Media Manager Uploading](wp-content/uploads/2011/01/media-manager-multiple-files.jpg "media-manager-multiple-files")

The new media manager upload function allows users to now upload multiple files at the same time. Bulk uploading of files saves time and reduces the amount of repeated tasks needed to manage your media.

### Trash System

![Article Manager: Trash](wp-content/uploads/2011/01/article-manager-trash.jpg "article-manager-trash")

The article system now has a inbuilt trashed article filter. All articles that are marked as trashed are given a new publishing state of trashed and are hidden away from the main article manager view. This doesn't remove the articles from the database but rather just hides them from being in a published state. Once the filtered view is changed to Trashed, then all the trashed articles are shown and options given to purge all trashed items.

### Automatic Core Updates

Anytime that Joomla updates or provides a new security release, there will be options to automatically update the core via your own Joomla installation. This is very much similar to that of WordPress where all you have to do is click UPDATE in the admin area and the system will automatically update itself!

### Package Installations

Developers now have the options to install extensions via packages. This means that when installing a complex Joomla extension, you don't have to install multiple files or the components, modules and plugins, the one package will install them all.

### Access Control Levels

![Joomla Access Control Levels](wp-content/uploads/2011/01/access-control-levels.jpg "access-control-levels")

One of the greatest features in the new Joomla 1.6 is the addition of the access control levels. Joomla 1.5 has always had problems with controlling multiple membership and access levels. Now with Joomla 1.6 you can have complete control over how and what your user on your website see and have access to. This is true for both the front end and backend of the website!

### No Legacy Mode

Previously in Joomla 1.5 we saw a legacy mode which enabled Joomla 1.0.x extensions be installed onto Joomla 1.5 installations. Now that this legacy layer has been removed in Joomla 1.6, developers are now all forced to adopt the new Joomla 1.6 framework for all new extensions.

### Nested Categories

Joomla 1.6 also sees the introduction of nested categories. In Joomla 1.5, administrators were limited to sections and then 1 child level of sections being categories. Now administrators can have an unlimited number of nested categories.

### New SEO functions

Joomla 1.6 also sees a huge list of new SEO features. Metadata can now be added to various parts and levels in Joomla. Metadata can be added to all, articles, [categories](http://joomtraining.com.au/tutorials/joomla-1.6/metadata-for-categories "metadata for categories") and menu items. This means that no page will be left metadataless or having the default global metadata.

### 404 Redirect Components

![Redirect Manager](wp-content/uploads/2011/01/redirect-manager.jpg "redirect-manager")

The new [404 redirect component](http://joomtraining.com.au/tutorials/joomla-1.6/creating-a-page-redirect "404 Redirects component") allows for easy management of 404 errors on a Joomla 1.6 website. Old URLs are entered into the component with the new destination URLs defined.

### Manual User Approvals

In Joomla 1.5 we saw the plaguing issue of bots automatically registering themselves on websites. This mean for a lot of spam. Now in Joomla 1.6, administrators have a choice of [manually approving new users](http://joomtraining.com.au/tutorials/joomla-1.6-tutorials/user-account-approvals "account activation and approving") on the website. This takes away automated access to websites and complete control over how can access it.

### New Core Templates

[![Joomla 1.6 Default website](wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Joomla-1.6-Demo-Site-Home-20110110.jpg "Joomla 1.6 Demo Site - Home")](http://j16.pbwebdev.com)

Joomla 1.6 also sees a a beautiful bundle of new web templates in its distribution. One in particular, Beez2 shows a great level of web accessibility. See the [demo site](http://j16.pbwebdev.com "Joomla 1.6 Demo site") of Beez2

Having BEEZ2 as the default template that is installed with Joomla will ensure many new users that use the default template will be building web accessible websites.
