For those out there that use Twitter on a daily basis for their business or keeping in contact with their friends, most likely use it in on their smart phones, external apps or via different websites. I for one almost never use the actual Twitter.com website to Tweet. Instead I prefer to use apps such as TweetDeck on the iPad, or Hoot Suite on the web.

We've been watching the slow roll out of the new Twitter user interface on the iPad and on the web and have been liking it very much. It might actually be worth using the actual website now with its new features and functionality.
