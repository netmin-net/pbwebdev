[![WordPress](http://cdn.churchcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/wordpress-logo-180x180.jpg "WordPress Logo")](http://cdn.churchcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/wordpress-logo-180x180.jpg)We here at PB Web Development not only build Joomla website but we also build quite a few WordPress websites too. We're all looking forward to some great new changes that are coming out in the next version of WordPress due for release late 2010.

### What is WordPress?

WordPress is a lightweight content management / blogging system that allows the user to easily publish their content on a website quickly and easily. WordPress has great image management facilities as well as a very user friendly admin interface that allows for easy addition and updating of content on a website. It is a great platform for small to large content based websites.

Work is well underway on [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) 3.1 and a quick update detailing the status of some of the new features as we approach the November 1st code freeze [has been posted](http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/2010/10/14/feature-status-post-formats-landed-d/).
