![Sydney WordPress Meetup sponsored by Campaign Monitor](wp-content/uploads/2011/10/campaign-monitor-wordpress-sydney-meetup.jpg "campaign-monitor-wordpress-sydney-meetup")Had a great night tonight sponsored by Campaign Monitor thanks guys! Tonight was an open topic night where it was an open discussion for everyone. I should have collated a list of questions before hand but I didn't get a chance to.

Also sorry for the strange early empty post, I was trying to get this plugin for WordPress working that would automatically pull in the photos from my Fan page of the night from Facebook but it didn't work out the way I wanted it to. It might have worked if it was pulling the images from the managing account but didn't work from a Fan page.

To see all of the images of the night please visit the Meetup.com page for the meetup or see [http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150420394870862.409805.152767770861&type=3](http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150420394870862.409805.152767770861&type=3 "Facebook album of Sydney WordPress Meetup group")
