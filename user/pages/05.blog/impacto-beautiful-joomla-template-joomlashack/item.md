![Impacto from JoomlaShack Feature](wp-content/uploads/2010/10/impacto-joomla-shack.jpg "Impacto from JoomlaShack Feature")

JoomlaShack has always provided simple but good templates for the Joomla developer market. Well designed and well coded Joomla templates are always hard to find. The series of new templates that are being produced by JoomlaShack, will keep Joomla Shack at the top of the list of Joomla template producers and developers.

Joomla Shack's new template Impacto is no exception. At first glance we noticed a few subtle HTML5 features such as the use of CSS drop shadows.

[![JoomlaShack Impacto](wp-content/uploads/2010/10/joomla-shack-impacto.png "JoomlaShack Impacto")](https://joomlashack.infusionsoft.com/go/impjs/buipy001/)

The template also features various layout combinations and options making it very flexible while maintaining a professional look and feel.

### Installation of the Joomla Template

This template comes packaged as a quick launch template as well, which means all of the files and structure needed to get the template and site up and running can be done in just a few clicks making installing the Joomla template and installing the Joomla site as easy as clicking a few buttons.

### Template Colour Schemes

Impacto also comes in 4 different variety of colours as well, blue, orange, green and red. All of which look clean and professional.

### Template Menu System

Menu system is dynamic, light and fast loading. We haven't had a chance to have a look at the code of the template yet but if it is anything like their others then it should be of a good standard.

### Joomla SEO Enhancement

Many of the new templates that are being released are being released with a great deal of HTML overrides to help with SEO as the provide cleaner, semantic and tableless layouts. Page structure and layout is the key here and JoomlaShack claim to have it down packed with their latest Joomla template. Content is king and should always come first.

If you're building a new Joomla site and are in need of a template, make sure you keep this one in mind.
