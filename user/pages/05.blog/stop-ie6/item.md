Recently Google had been hacked by exploiting security flaws in IE6. We highly recommend that anyone still using IE6 to stop using it. The cost of upgrading to the new operating system or moving to a different browser at least is minimal compared to having your private information stolen.

Further more, the explanation on how to use the hack has been made public and even Microsoft has released statements for users to ditch IE6 and XP and upgrade to Windows 7, even if it is just for the security patches.
