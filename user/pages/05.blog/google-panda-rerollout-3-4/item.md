Google have announced that they have tweaked the search algorithm that they released with the huge Google Panda update.

For many of the people that exploit the search engine this means that their site may get hit. Some have even reported to have been completely delisted off Google.

[link to Google's tweet about the update](#!/google/statuses/183312403100995584 "Google's latest panda update 3.4")

If you're doing things properly and building links naturally, then you should have nothing to worry about.

Some people that have been using third party link building networks have reported that they have been effected. Some of these third party link building networks have also been completely removed from the internet.

According to one of these such services in their [latest blog post](http://www.buildmyrank.com/news/its-been-a-great-run), basically all of their link bulding websites have been delisted from the search engine ending their business altogether.

If you're using one of these link building networks to build up your page rank and search engine results, I highly recommend that you get off them before it is too late.

Only time will tell how this update will affect that 1.6% of searches.
