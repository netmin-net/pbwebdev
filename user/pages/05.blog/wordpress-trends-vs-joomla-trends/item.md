PB Web Development is primarily an open source design and development company concentrating on solutions such as WordPress, Joomla, Magento and OpenCart. Depending on the situation we will use a different solution that will best suit the requirements and the client.

For the majority of the website that we design and build upon, they usually are build upon Joomla.

Recently we've been taking note of the changes in the trends and major search terms that people are using to find out services. Looking into Google Trends, we can see that these have change hugely with a pivot point around October 2010.

What caused such a shift and what caused the drop in the usage of Joomla at that point in time. To look at it another way, what reduced the amount of searches for the particular keyword phrases around “joomla development” and “joomla developer”.

Take a look at the latest trends report from Google for the terms:

- Joomla development
- WordPress development
- Joomla developer
- WordPress developer

The development phrases are aimed at people amusingly looking for development companies and looking for a team where as developer phrases are looking for more freelancers and solo developers.

No matter how you look at both of the two key phrases, there is a clear and definite indication that Joomla development desires are well on the decline and WordPress development continues to rise at a staggering rate compared to pre 2010.

There may be several contribution factors to this change but one factor could have been the release of Joomla 1.6 around that time in late 2010 and the growth of fork projects such as Nooku which started to grow in popularity at that time.

The biggest change to the Joomla project was the dropping of backwards compatibility which mean good things for forward moving developers but bad things for website builders that were stuck with extensions and website migrations on Joomla 1.5.

This is all speculation but it may have had an effect on the search trends over time. The difficulty of upgrading and migrating from Joomla 1.5 to later versions may have been too painful of a migration for many people abandoning Joomla at that point and rebuilding later on with WordPress which was maturing into more of a CMS than a blogging platform.

What ever the reason there is a drop with Joomla trends and searches from that point and if the Joomla project wants to see more growth, perhaps lessons could be learnt from that period of time and change and how the community and website builders reacted to the change.

It is a well known fact that Joomla 1.5 migrations are painful and not all the migration extensions work perfectly out of the box. Perhaps more information about migrations, what is was and how to possibly perform then back then was required. Perhaps more education about being able to stay on the older platform (1.5), would have been perfectly fine for a few more years.

If you're a Joomla! fan and a regular user, what do you think caused the drop in the search trends for these two common Joomla search phrases and have you seen the same issues with other similar search terms around Joomla! or have you seen an increase in more long tail keyword phrases for Joomla?
