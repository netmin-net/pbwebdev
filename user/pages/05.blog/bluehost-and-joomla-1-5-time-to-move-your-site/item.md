We've been told through social channels that a hosting company in the States, BlueHost, have stated that they will be suspending websites that are running Joomla 1.5 as they believe it is insecure and ruining their servers. Originally sourced from this article on **[OSTraining](http://www.ostraining.com/blog/joomla-news/bluehost-joomla-1-5/).**

Joomla 1.5 can still be secure if maintained properly and we can help you there.

Never the less, BlueHost will be shutting down websites that are on their servers and running Joomla 1.5.

So what do you do now? We can help out with a few options!

So what are your options now that your are being forced to take action?

## Move Hosting Companies

The first and easiest thing to do is to move hosting companies. Taking a simple backup of your website and moving to a hosting company site as SiteGround or Anchor that can handle a Joomla 1.5 site and keep it secure.

We can patch your website to the latest 1.5 security patches that will ensure that your website will remain secure for the time being.

Putting in place good security practises and a decent backup plan will also help you keep your website going on the Joomla 1.5 platform until you have time to action the full upgrade and migrate to a later version of the CMS.

 

## Migrate (Upgrade) from Joomla 1.5 -> Joomla 2.5 or Joomla 3.2

Your second and more desired course of action is to fully update your website to Joomla 2.5 and if possible Joomla 3.2.

This will ensure the life span and security of your website as these two versions are still under maintenance and being supported by the Joomla teams.

Moving over to the latest versions of Joomla will also allow you to add on all the other extensions and goodies that are available for later versions of the CMS, not to mention security patches, usability upgrades and many new features.

## Take Action

Whatever you choose, it is important to do it sooner rather than later as BlueHost will shut down your site altogether.
