[![Kampyle Integrator for Joomla](wp-content/uploads/2010/04/kampyle-integrator-150x150.png "Kampyle Integrator Plug-in for Joomla")](wp-content/uploads/2010/04/kampyle-integrator.png)We use Kampyle on a lot of our Joomla websites for gathering feedback from our customers. So we built this nifty little Joomla plug-in that allows for the insertion of the Kampyle top CSS code and bottom JavaScript code into a Joomla website without the need for modification to the templates or files.

It give the ability for a novice to integrate this highly powerful feedback analytics software into any Joomla based website.

Simply download the plug-in, install it, enable it in the plug-in manager and paste in your Feedback form code from your [Kampyle account](https://www.kampyle.com/feedback-form-kampyle/?r=joomla "link to Kampyle Account signup") and away you go.
