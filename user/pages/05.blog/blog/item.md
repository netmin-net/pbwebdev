![Fireworks at the Sydney Opera House](http://nadineandthecity.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/apec-australia-2007-sydney-opera-house-fireworks.jpg "Fireworks at the Sydney Opera House")As the year winds up and Christmas celebrations come to an end, we thought it would be a good time to have a look back over the year and see how far we have come as a growing web design and development studio in Sydney.

We started the year still fresh in Sydney only just settling into our new office in Potts Point. Picking up client after client here in Sydney we saw our first New South Wales Government client as well as our first Federal Government client. We had a feeling that all those years of working in the Government would come in handy.

We also welcomed our first staff member, Shannon Briggs to the team and our little office getting slightly more crowded.

Our current relationships with our clients grew with the development of new projects and redevelopment of older websites.

So far this year we‚Äôve seen over 20 websites designed by Martina and over 30 websites being developed by Shannon and myself.

Our business networks in Sydney have extended as well as the content management systems that we use. We now officially use WordPress, Joomla and Drupal for solutions for our clients.

### Message from Peter

It has been a great 2010. We definitely have established ourselves now here in Sydney and 2011 is the year for expansion. I hope to pick up a few more Government clients as well as implement our new marketing strategy for 2011, creating more brand awareness for PB Web Development.

### Message from Martina

What an amazing year 2010 has been! I have been very fortunate to work with some high profile clients as well as the loveliest and most enthusiastic of small business owners. Each project has been a wonderful journey and I look forward to creating an even better 2011 with both our clients and our staff at PB Web Dev.
