As most of the people that read this blog work in IT and the web I thought it would be nice to remind everyone to do their eye exercises to help keep what little eye sight we have left.

The lovely people over at [Mezzmer](http://www.mezzmer.com/blog/healthy-eyes-in-a-digital-world/) have created this fantastic info graphic to remind of is the best practises when it comes to working at the computer for hours on end.

Beware of computer radiation and remember the 20-20-20 rule, every 20 minutes, take a 20 second break, focus on something 20 feet or a longer distance away.
