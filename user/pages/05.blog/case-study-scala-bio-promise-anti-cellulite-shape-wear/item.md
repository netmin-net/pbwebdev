Client: BrazCom Imports  
 Site: [http://www.scalabiopromise.com.au  
](http://www.scalabiopromise.com.au)Type: E-commerce

## Client Overview

Based in Adelaide, BrazCom Imports, import women‚Äôs clothing products for distribution in Australia. They are the exclusive distributor of the Scala BioPromise range as well as the slimming shape wear range for women.

## Project Requirements

Being base in Adelaide, Australia, the client required a simple e-commerce solution that they could manage as well as integrate into Australian merchant facilities and postal services. The website also needed to integrate into a third party warehousing and distribution centre called SupplyLink. Site optimisation for speed is also needed as the high amounts of web traffic was expected due to external marketing and PR. The anti cellulite and slimming shape wear is highly popular across the globe and traffic demands on websites are always high.

## Solution

PB Web Development provided the hosting environment for the website and cloud storage for the website to reduce bandwidth usage. PB Web Development used Joomla and VirtueMart in this instance to meet the client‚Äôs requirements. JoomlArt‚Äôs S3 storage component was also used in this built to integrate Amazon S3 services into the website.

## Development Team

Martina Kocian, worked with the client to come up with the website design, while Shannon Briggs implemented the design. Peter Bui developed the Joomla and Virtuemart solution and customisation and site/server optimisation.

## Result

The resulting website provided BrazCom Imports the ability to easily update and customise their site. Joomla and VirtueMart provided the perfect solution for what BrazCom Imports needed. The level of customisation of the site allowed for a fully automated system, which only needed a little monitoring and management of stock levels.

The S3 storage system reduce the total bandwidth usage on the server reducing overall server costs and bandwidth usage.

Creating the fully automated process from, customer ordering and payment to, customer follow up and product distribution meant that more free time can be spent managing their business and marketing their products.
