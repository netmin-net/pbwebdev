A fantastic presentation by Tom Standage, on The Future of Social Media, a Historic Perspective.

“In recent years the internet has enabled a flowering of easy-to-use publishing tools that have made media more social, participatory and conversational in nature. But this phenomenon is not as new as it appears. The roots of social media be traced back to Roman times.” Tom presents a unique perspective of how all media was social until only recently in the last 200 years.

He definitely seems like a great person to have over for a few bottles of wine and enlightening conversation.
