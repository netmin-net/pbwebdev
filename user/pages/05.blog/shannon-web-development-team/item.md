This month we'd like to welcome Shannon to our web developer team here in Sydney. His role here will be to implement the stunning designs that Martina has been producing as well as provide trouble shooting and support for our clients.

Shannon's background as a DJ and experience in radio should make things interesting for a few future plans that we have here at PB Web Development.

We're glad to have him on the team here and have thrown him in the deep end on some or our web development projects with our Sydney clients. We look forward to see more of his work online.
