This week's search engine optimisation tip is going to be about semantic web layouts and how they can help with the optimisation of a website. This is a a very good technique that I use for a lot of my clients. Completely removing all of the design aspects from the website template and then optimizing content and heading tags in the body works wonders and is a fantastic basis to start working on a search engine campaign.

### What is the Semantic Web and Semantic Web Design

> “The Semantic Web is about two things. It is about common formats for integration and combination of data drawn from diverse sources, where on the original Web mainly concentrated on the interchange of documents. It is also about language for recording how the data relates to real world objects. That allows a person, or a machine, to start off in one database, and then move through an unending set of databases which are connected not by wires but by being about the same thing.” – [WC3 Web Semantic Activity](http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/)

For what we want to do here, a part of Semantic Web is basically the process of separating the information in a web page from its design in order for a machine, computer or search engine, to be able to read this information and data in its purest form. What this means is that the Semantic Web Layout of the web page is done in such a way that is best suited for a machine but still visually appealing for a human being.
