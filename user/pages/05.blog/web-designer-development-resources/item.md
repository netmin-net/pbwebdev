[![Wed developer resource Joomla](wp-content/uploads/2011/04/20110407-083946.jpg "Wed developer resource Joomla")](wp-content/uploads/2011/04/20110407-083946.jpg)

One valuable resource web designers and web developers get ideas and inspiration from is magazines. One magazine that I have a subscription to is the Web Designer magazine from the UK.

I was pleasantly surprised to see this month's issue roll out with a huge Joomla logo on the front cover and an in-depth 6 page article about the Joomla CMS. For once these magazines aren't talking about WordPress.

It's has a nice write up about the growth and history of Joomla since 1995. What? 1995??? Really? I think they might have stuffed up a date there. Furthermore, the facts look right and Mambo is only mentioned 3 times.

The article mentions Joomla 1.6 and also a little bit about Andrew Eddie. It also talks about various important extensions, template shops such as RocketTheme and even goes through some very nice showcases.

Overall it is a fantastic piece promoting Joomla and pushing it into the public limelight. It is about time that it gets a bit more press than WordPress.

If you'd like to see the article and you're in Sydney, come along to the Joomla User Group meeting next Tuesday night and I'll share the article with everyone then. Otherwise you can just buy a copy from the newsagent but I don't know if they're available just yet in Australia.
