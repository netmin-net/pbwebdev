We've finally found a nice little place to settle and set up office here in Sydney.

Just a 15 minute walk out of the Sydney CBD toward's Pott Point is where you'll find out new location. We'll be situated in Minton House, the same building that housed creative greats such as [Dinosaur Designs](http://www.dinosaurdesigns.com.au/), [Baz Luhrmann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baz_Luhrmann) and the creators of the highly successful [Tropfest](http://www.tropfest.com/).

### What does this mean for PB Web Development?

This means that we're finally ready to start creatives and developers here in Sydney. We'll have ample space to grow and improve our services for our customers.

### When will it happen?

Give us a few weeks. It takes time to negotiate some of these contracts and also to furnish the place.

Just keep on eye on the blog for new pictures of the office when we get things going.
