![Upgrade Joomla 1.5 to Joomla 1.6](wp-content/uploads/2011/01/upgrade.jpg "Upgrade Joomla 1.5 to Joomla 1.6")There is no defined upgrade path from Joomla 1.5 to Joomla 1.6. There are many changed to the core of Joomla itself that makes it very difficult to upgrade to Joomla 1.6 easily.

Since the launch of Joomla 1.6 on earlier this week there has been a few options for upgrading to the latest version just starting to pop up.

With so many core changes to Joomla 1.6 it is rather difficult to simply upgrade your website within a few clicks but it seems like there is a solution.

## Upgrading Options for Joomla 1.5 -> Joomla 1.6

I've been reading on the [Joomla forums](http://forum.joomla.org/viewtopic.php?f=625&t=583031 "Joomla upgrade from 1.5") about the disappointment of a lack of upgrade options for Joomla from version 1.5 to 1.6. Most of the comments are negative but out of the comments creep up a few migration options for users.

Please read over this submission here:

[http://cocoate.com/joomla-16-english/upgrade](http://cocoate.com/joomla-16-english/upgrade "Joomla 1.6 upgrade")

Submitted by [Hagen Graf](http://cocoate.com/user/hagen-graf "View user profile."), a valued contributor to the Joomla community, this site overviews everything that you need to get started with a Joomla 1.5 to Joomla 1.6 upgrade from server requirements to components to actually installing a potential migration script.

If you're site meets the required check points list for a Joomla 1.5 to Joomla 1.6 upgrade/migration then this will definitely help and speed up the process of upgrading.

We'll be trying out the script soon and writing our own documentation on it and provide some feedback to the developers.

The Joomla Documentation website also outlines some guidelines in upgrading your Joomla 1.5 to Joomla 1.6 website.

[http://docs.joomla.org/Tutorial:Migrating\_from\_Joomla\_1.5\_to\_Joomla\_1.6](http://docs.joomla.org/Tutorial:Migrating_from_Joomla_1.5_to_Joomla_1.6 "Joomla 1.5 -> Joomla 1.6 upgrade")

## Future Updates and Upgrade of Joomla 1.6 â€“ Joomla X.X

The forum posts also mention the easy of upgrading other CMS solutions like WordPress. Within a few clicks, a WordPress installation can have ALL of its plugins and core installation upgraded to the latest versions.

With the latest Joomla 1.6 we should also see that happen. Joomla 1.6 has its own new updating system that will help administrators update the core as well as extensions from third party developers.

In the future we shouldn't see any more difficult migrations of Joomla to the next versions.

## Good Luck

Good luck with upgrades and tell us how you go if you try it out. Providing feedback will help the rest of the Joomla community upgrade to Joomla 1.6.
