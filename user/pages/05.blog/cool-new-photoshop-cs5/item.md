I've seen a few videos of what the new Photoshop can do. It will be a while before we'll be upgrading to CS5 but just look at the box!

If you haven't seen some of the new features, its worth checking out these YouTube videos that I've come across over the past few weeks.

Be amazed by what contentAware is capable of. It will put image retouchers out of work and put an end to the top 10 worse photoshopping blog posts.
