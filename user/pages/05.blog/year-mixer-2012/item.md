![Meetup networking banner](wp-content/uploads/2012/10/meetup-banner.jpg)It's on again! Just like the one back in [June](http://www.meetup.com/Joomla-User-Group-Sydney/events/67960472/ "Mid Year Networking Session") with the massive turn out of over 150 people, we're doing another open source CMS mixer combining all of the groups together in one big networking session.

We here at PB Web Development believe that there isn't a CMS to rule them all, although we're very Joomla bias. We believe that there is much to be learnt from all the communities and coming together to share ideas will open us all up to building and creating better open source CMS solutions and communities.

So we'd like to extend the invite again to all the groups that were invited before from [WordPress](http://www.wpsydney.com.au/), [Joomla](http://www.meetup.com/Joomla-User-Group-Sydney/), [Drupal](http://www.meetup.com/drupalsydney/), [Magento](http://www.meetup.com/The-Sydney-Magento-Meetup/) and [Product Mavens](http://www.meetup.com/Product-Mavens/) to come together for a great networking session and of course a few drinks.

We already have a major sponsor for the event and a few other sponsors just about ready to sign up!
