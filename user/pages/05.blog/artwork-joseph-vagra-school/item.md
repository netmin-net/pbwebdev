A few weeks back Martina and I were walking through the Sydney Botanic Gardens when we stumbled across a student art exhibition being held by the [Joseph Varga School](http://www.josephvargaschool.nsw.edu.au/ "Joseph Varga School") which caters for students between the ages of 5-18 with learning disabilities, conduct disorders, and/or emotional disturbances. The school provides them with a safe environment where they can learn in a safe and stimulating environment.

The art exhibition displayed all of the students art works from the school and Martina and myself found ourselves surrounded by a multitude of talent and creative works from the students. It was amazing and inspiring to have found so much talent and creativity.

We bidded on a few art pieces in a silent auction and were surprised to have found out that we had won all of our bids!

Today we took a little tour of the school, visited the children that painted the art pieces and took home some amazing creations.

We're now proud owners of some unique and amazing artwork from the school and have left knowing that we've supported a great cause and hope to do more in the future.

I absolutely love my superheroes series of paintings which were done by a group of under 10 year olds!
