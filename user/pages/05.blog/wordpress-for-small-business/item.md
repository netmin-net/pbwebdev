The recent release of WordPress 3.0 has seen this humble platform jump forward leaps and bounds. Whilst in it's early days it was easy to dismiss WordPress as nothing more than a simple (but very good) blogging platform. It only took a small scratch under the surface to realise that this wasn't the case. WordPress' source of pride has always been an impressive engine under the hood. Those with a little amount of know how and elbow grease were able to produce impressive large scale web sites, with full content management capabilities at the clients fingertips. It was not long before WordPress became the web developers choice, whilst also going on to influence the visual landscape of the web itself.

WordPress is the perfect self publishing platform for any small business websites that doesn't need extensive functionality and work flow some larger organisations may require. If you run a small business or operate from home the WordPress could be the perfect solution for you.

Version 3.0 not only boasts the addition of some much needed features and improvements, but also makes it even easier to produce and maintain highly flexible websites, whilst giving the client more control over the look and behavior of their website.

Learning to use WordPress has always been a breeze. It's user friendly interface and logical layout makes it simple enough for even someone with the smallest amount of experience in web development to snap together a fully functional website in minutes. A growing online community at the ready to help out those in need, coupled with the countless resources spread all over the net – there really isn't any excuse not to get your hands dirty with WordPress.

Whilst learning to use WordPress can be generally done with minimal time, if you are serious about owning and maintaining a website it's time to get a couple of good books. Our hand picked titles below are not only great reference tools that you will refer back to time and again, but are also highly regarded for being suitable for people with next to little to no experience in using a content management system and managing websites.
