![Sydney Joomla User Group Logo](http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/9/0/1/global_19874593.jpeg "Sydney Joomla User Group Logo")This month for the Sydney Joomla User Group meeting we'll be hearing from Sydney's best Drupal developers, Ryan Cross. I've been told that he'll be talking to the Joomla User Group about Drupal. So if you're a Joomla user and wanted to start looking at Drupal as an alternative CMS then please come along on the night to find out more about Drupal.

**Venue:** (thanks to Tim Plummer)  
 InterfaceFLOR  
 101 Chalmers Street  
 Surrey Hills

**Map/directions:**  
*Arriving by train:* From Central station, take the Devonshire Street exit. InterfaceFLOR building is first building on the right. Reception is via a path to the back of the building on right hand side near driveway/train tracks.  
*Arriving by road:* The building is not next to number 100, it's opposite the bottom of Devonshire St, the last builidng before Central Station. Go round the back of the building to the right and press the intercom button.

To find out more information about the user group, please visit, [Joomla.org.au](http://joomla.org.au/sydney-joomla-user-group/sydney-jug-next-meeting-tue-8th-march "Sydney Joomla User Group") and also the [Sydney Joomla User Group meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Joomla-User-Group-Sydney/ "Meetup") website.

I think I'll be going to the bar on the other side of the street afterwards if anyone is interested in coming along for more of a chat and drinks.
