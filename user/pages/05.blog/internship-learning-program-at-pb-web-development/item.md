From time to time we take on Interns and teach them the ropes of web design and development at PB Web Development.

Everything from the basics of CSS all the way to PHP development using Joomla and WordPress.

If you're interested in what we provide, please have a look at our weekly progress outline that we push all of our interns and staff inductions through before being able to work at PB Web Development.

 

## Week 1

- HTML & CSS Basics
- LESS & SASS
- Bootstrap framework
- Accessibility & Inclusive design principles
- Template conversion from PSD design to working template
- Conversion of Template into a Joomla template
- Conversion of Template into a WordPress theme

This week is aimed and defining the core basics of what all front end developers should know in regards to building up a website. We start with the basic static website template and convert the minimum using PHP and CMS based code to convert it into a working theme or template.

 

## Week 2

- Git Basics
- Pull Requests
- Merging
- Deploying and maintaining code

This week is another essential week of learning the basics. In the modern world of web design and development we need to track our code that we write and this week looks at the fundamentals of using git to track and maintain code. The final step is deploying that code, whether it is using script or continuous integration methodologies, this week will look at the best ways of deploying your code and getting your site online.

 

## Week 3

- Building a Joomla Website
- Content and structure
- Modules
- Menu Management
- Components and Extending Joomla
- Site building exercises

We are primarily a Joomla house, meaning we build the majority of our websites using Joomla. This week concentrates on the basics of what you need to know in regards to building a Joomla website properly. All the ‘gotchas' and tricks to get the most out of your Joomla based website.

 

## Week 4

- Joomla Templating Basics
- Joomla template frameworks
- T3 framework basics
- Best practises using the T3 framework
- Conversion of templates into T3 framework

We are also a T3 framework house. We use the T3 framework to build just about all of our websites from the ground up. This week concentrates on the basics of the T3 framework, its benefits and how to use it properly in a new website.

At the end of the first 4 weeks, the participant should have been able to build a Joomla site and template from scratch. Being able to turn a designed website in PSD format to a working site is the essential skill of a front end developer.

 

## Week 5

- Managing and upgrading Joomla base website
- Site & Server maintenance around Joomla sites

Once a website is up and running, you will need to maintain the server and the website as well. This week we look at all the tools that we use to monitor our websites, update them and keeping them maintained.

 

## Week 6

- WordPress theme building basics, child themes
- Building WordPress themes using frameworks
- Using Customizr as a framework, basics and fundamentals
- Conversion of a theme into the Customizr framework

When building WordPRess themes, we either use the base theme that comes with WordPress or the Customizr framework that allows us to use Bootstrap. (Bootstrap is at the core of Joomla so it makes templating and theming in either system easier if you know Bootstrap).

 

## Week 7

- WordPress maintenance
- Building a WordPress Website
- Content and structure
- Widgets
- Menu Management
- Plugins and Extending WordPress
- Site building exercises

As well as building Joomla based website we have many clients on WordPress websites as well. This week looks at building a WordPress website from scratch.

 

## Week 8

A key aspect of being a part of a team and running a web studio is the customer service aspect. This is when we incorporate the skills and etiquette in regards to working with clients. Everything from managing the customer and client, working with the client on project and account management aspects.

 

The following last month is when the participant takes on real life case studies, usually for non-profit organisations that are getting their work done pro-bono. Under the watchful eye of a mentor at this time, the participant takes on several websites and builds them to the customer's requirements.
