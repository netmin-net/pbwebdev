Joomla has just released a new update for Joomla 1.5.

If you're using Joomla 1.5 it is highly recommended that you have your Joomla installation upgraded to the latest iteration.

### What Version of Joomla Am I Using?

You can find this out when you login to your Joomla website's administrator area. Look at the top right hand area of the screen and you should see some information about the version that you are using.

If it is anything less than 1.5.23 then please request to have your Joomla installation updated.

Most PB Web Development clients will have this done automatically as a part of their hosting package or service level agreement.
