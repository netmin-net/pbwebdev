![Adelaide Joomla User Group](wp-content/uploads/2010/10/adelaide-joomla-user-group.jpg "Adelaide Joomla User Group")

It has been a few months since I, Peter Bui, have managed to make it out to a Joomla User Group meeting in Adelaide. With other work and social commitments, illness and health it has been quite hard at times.

Overall it is good to see that the Joomla User Group in Adelaide is still going strong with the committed work of Greg and Jared over the past few months to keep things going.

Tuesday, 26th of October covered:

- Chromo forms and general form building in Joomla presented by Greg from ProBiz
- The JoomlaDay.org.au website rebuild
- Open questions and demo time

Its good to see new members in the Adelaide coming into the Joomla User Groups and hopefully you all come back again soon.

Looking forward to next month's meetup to be held on Monday 22nd November and most likely will be the last for the year.
