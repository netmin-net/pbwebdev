Our hosting providers will be doing proactive and preventative maintenance in the data centre over the next few weeks to ensure the best operating environment for our customer's systems.

- Sunday, 16th May 2010, 8am – 10am AEST
- Sunday, 23rd May 2010, 8am – 10am AEST

AusWeb and Equinix plan to complete scheduled works in line with our maintenance program which may affect your cabinet(s).

Maintenance will involve two scheduled outages over two sequential weekends. This maintenance has been scheduled to occur on Sunday, out of business hours for the majority of customers.

- Primary Power Feeds – Sunday, 16th May:2010, 8am-10am AEST
- Redundant Power Feeds – Sunday, 23rd May:2010, 8am-10am AEST

The total time for each single power strip outage is scheduled at 2 hours per power service (Primary and Redundant) on each weekend inside the maintenance window.

On May 16th the primary circuits will incur an outage and on the 23rd the redundant circuits will be affected.

As a precaution, we'll be performing manual backups of all of our sites that are under our maintenance agreements over the next week.

If you have any concerns please don't hesitate to [contact us](/contact).
