When fan pages were first introduced to Facebook I thought the custom landing pages were a brilliant idea. It was an easy way to get the most important and current users to new fans to hopefully entice them to become new fans that you can engage on a regular basis.

Even though it seems so good I never actually had a chance to really play around with the Facebook Markup Language (FBML) and make good use out of it.

Recently though I had to dive into it as I was working on a social media campaign that really needed to engage the end users.

What I found was that Facebook had removed the static FBML app for custom tabs which meant the old method of creating the tabs was no longer available.

After a little bit of investigation, I found that now the way to do it was with building your own custom Facebook Apps.

Further more I saw some new changes to the Facebook Apps that made it really easy to import in external content from any other website. Great! No you can create rich media and dynamic landing pages without needed to learn ANY FBML!

What this means that you can actually use your very own public website powered by Joomla to generate the content for your Facebook Fan page. After a quick 30 minute session of creating a new template published a few modules and had a Facebook landing page all setup and pulling in RSS feeds and information from my website.

Check out the fan page here:

Please also become a fan ðŸ˜‰

## Download the Facebook App Template for Joomla

It isn't a work of art but I've packaged the template for Joomla 1.5 and made it accessible for download for anyone else that might want to setup a Facebook App pulling in content from their Joomla powered website.

- Download the [Joomla Facebook App template](http://www.pbwebdev.com.au/blog/fuser-template-facebook-fan-pages#download "Joomla Facebook App Template") for Joomla 1.5.
- Download the [Joomla Facebook App template](http://www.pbwebdev.com.au/blog/fuser-template-facebook-fan-pages#download) for Joomla 1.6

## Documentation

More documentation on setting up the template and the Facebook app to pull in the content can be found on [JoomTraining.com.au](http://www.joomtraining.com.au "Joomla Training Australia")

There are plenty of modules and components out there that allow you to pull in and integrate Facebook into your Joomla website in terms of Fan boxes, social media buttons and other great Facebook open graph plugins but not much that puts your website content back onto Facebook.

Hopefully this method of custom Facebook landing page tied in with automated RSS feeds to Facebook will help others reach and engage their users and fan base on a new level.
