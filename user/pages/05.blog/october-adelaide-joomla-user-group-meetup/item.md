This event will be right after the Sydney Joomla Day 09, so we'll be bringing back some news, information and other ideas from the event.

From last meetup, a popular topic would be template building from scratch.

I will also present my topic from Joomla Day Sydney on speed optimisation for Joomla.

Please [RSVP](/registration "Register for Adelaide Joomla User Group") to be notified of location.

### Date and Time:

Wednesday, October 21st 2009, 5:30pm-8:00pm.

We'll need a note taker for the night.
