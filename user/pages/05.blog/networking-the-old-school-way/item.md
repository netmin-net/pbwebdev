The team here at PB Web Development have created a pull up banner for your live networking Meetup events.

People put so much emphasis on social networking these days.

Twitter this, Facebook that, LinkedIn this etc. People are forgetting some of the more traditional ways of connecting with customers, clients and creating some of the potential leads the way it used to be done.

This is why I'm a huge fan of user groups, Meetups and networking events. As a business owner I aim to go to a different networking event at least once a week switching between the Joomla User Group, WordPress Meetup, Product Mavens Product Management meetup and a few more.

I like to get involved with the communities as well and help organise some of the events and sessions. As a result, a few years ago we designed some meetup banners to help attendees find exactly where the meetup venue was. Sometimes the venues were a little obscure and hard to find – adding a great big pull up banner with the Meetup logo and a map marker made it easy for new attendees to find the entrances.

On another note, we are also advocates of open source and love to share things with the community. Hence I'd like to share the artwork files that we used to create the pull up banners for our meetups to the rest of the world.

The artwork is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) but this does not apply to the Meetup logo. Do what ever you want with the artwork here, just don't mess with the Meetup logo.

I ask that you stick within the rules and requirements in regards to the Meetup brand as there are legal implications if you don't. The legal information can be found under the [Promote](http://www.meetup.com/Joomla-User-Group-Sydney/grow/links/ "Logo promotion usage") area of your meetup page. You may also want to take a look at the [terms and conditions from Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/terms/) as well, part 16 refers to trademarks and copyrights.
