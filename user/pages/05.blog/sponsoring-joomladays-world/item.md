![JoomlaDays 2013 World Wide](wp-content/uploads/2012/10/joomla-days-2013.png)2012 has been a big year of JoomlaDays. With [29 JoomlaDays in 2012](http://docs.joomla.org/Joomla!_Days/History#2012 "JoomlaDay in 2012") around the world we're seeing more and more support for the Joomla project around the world. PB Web Development this year were lucky enough so sponsor three JoomlaDays around the world, JoomlaDay New England, JoomlaDay South Africa and JoomlaDay Sydney but as our training arm, JoomTraining.

We were pretty proud to have sponsored all of these JoomlaDays around the world and help communities on a global scale.

## JoomlaDays We've Sponsored

- [JoomlaDay New England](http://www.joomladaynewengland.org/)
- [JoomlaDay South Africa](http://www.joomladay.org.za/)
- [JoomlaDay Sydney](http://sydney.joomladay.org.au)
- and maybe [JoomlaDay Melbourne 2013](http://melbourne.joomladay.org.au/)…

## JoomlaDays We've Attended in 2012

- Just JoomlaDay Sydney this year.

## JoomlaDays in 2013

We'd most definately want to go to JoomlaDay Melbourne as Peter van Westen and Brian Teeman will be visiting from overseas. JandBeyond has seemed to be a highlight on the Joomla event calendar for the past three years and is definately another Joomla conference we'd love to go see.

The line up and presentations of all the JoomlaDays around the world have just been increasing in quailty more and more each year.

We're looking forward to seeing what 2013 will bring.
