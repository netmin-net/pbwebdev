We've been going through the process of migrating all of our client websites over to our dedicated server where we have huge amounts of space and resources compared to that of our original environment. More RAM, more hard drive space and more CPU power!

The migration process took place over the weekend and for most people, you should have even notice it happening. There are a few accounts that are left on the old server and will be migrated over this week.  
If you're having issues after the migrations, please contact us so we can resolve the issues straight away, (02) 4017 0249.
