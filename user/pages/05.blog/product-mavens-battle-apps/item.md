This month at Product Mavens we tried something a little different for the topic of the night. Instead of having a planned presentation and feeding information to the meetup group, we had a discussion panel where they had questions fired at them about certain aspects of mobile and a product platform.

More photos of the night can be found at the [meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/Product-Mavens/photos/7544172/ "Product Mavens Meetup Group").
