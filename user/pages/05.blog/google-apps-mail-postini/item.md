We've been playing around with a Google Apps environment for the last few months now and have the services very beneficial.

What I have personally found interesting is the integration of the Postini service in to the Google Mail services. Once the service has been set up within your domain's MX records, it starts to filter all of the mail that goes through your system.

Google Mail's own spam filters are great, but this is an additional layer that sits on top of that to filter out more additional spam that might still get through.

These are now the notifications that we see instead of the constant source of emails from India that constantly hound us for out sourced work.

If you find that your inbox is filled with more than 50 junk emails a day, switching your mail system over to Google Apps might be a worth while investment. If you haven't heard of or tried Postini, do check it out. If is worth the time and investment: <http://www.google.com/postini/>
