In doing some research on user experience today, I stumbled across this interesting presentation video of Lisa Herrod at Ideas 4 2008 on usability.

Lisa Herrod, of scenarioseven.com.au, gives her talk “Usability is More Than Skin Deep.” The slides for this presentation are available at http://www.slideshare.net/LisaHerrod/usability-more-than-skin-deep

Lisa was speaking at Ideas 4, run by the Australian Web Industry Association on January 30, 2008.
