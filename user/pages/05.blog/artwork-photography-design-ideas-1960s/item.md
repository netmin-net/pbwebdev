In doing some research for some design work here in the Sydney office, I've come across an amazing collection of 1960's imagery in the form of photos, and artwork.

Have a look at this collection and let us know what you think. They had some strange ideas back in the 60's.

It's interesting to see that the â€˜trashy' magazine slogans and tag lines haven't changed much in 50 years.
