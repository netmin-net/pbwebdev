**Client**: Local Market Guide  
** URL**: [http://www.localmarketguide.com.au](http://www.localmarketguide.com.au "link to Local Market Guide")  
** Development Time**: 3 months  
** Category**: Start up business  
**CMS:** Joomla

## **Client Bio**

Local Market Guide required a web content management system that was flexible enough to present general information about markets around Sydney and Australia as well as news and resources for market. The client has also done research on the best content management system for their type of website model and narrowed it down to either Joomla or WordPress.

Designer/Developer: PB Web Development (PBWEBDEV)  
 URL: [PBWebDev.com.au](http://www.pbwebdev.com.au "link to PB Web Development")

## Developer Bio

Located in both Adelaide and Sydney, Australia, PB Web Development is a small web studio that builds Joomla websites for startups, small business, non profit organisations and government clients around the Australia.

## Development Team

Martina Kocian designed the all aspects of design for Local Market Guide from the logo to general branding and digital designs such as the website design and email design template for their regular newsletters. Peter Bui and Shannon Briggs worked and developed the semantic template and backend Joomla build.

## **The Challenge**

PB Web Development has ample experience in both content management systems, Joomla and WordPress, and was able to guide the client through the various differences, advantages and disadvantages of both systems.

The design of the site had to capture the vibrant market feel experienced by the client from their trips to markets around the world. PB Web Development aimed to capture the essence of the clients travel to these markets and provide it in a usable website for its Sydney based audience.

## The Extensions

The development of the website used an in-house template framework with some extra additional components to meet the functional requirements. K2 was used to build the content structure or the site and Sobi2 used to organise the market directory. Final JCalPro was used for the upcoming events.

List of Extensions Used:

- K2 – <http://getk2.org/>
- Sobi2 – [http://www.sigsiu.net/sobi2.html](http://www.sigsiu.net/sobi2.html "link to Sobi2 content construction kit")
- JCalPro – <http://dev.anything-digital.com/>

## The Results

The final website met all of the functional requirements and visual requirements of the client providing them with a fully functional online business. Joomla mixed with K2 and Sobi made the perfect combination for what the client needed.
