![JoomlaDay NYC logo](http://itevent.net/wp-content/uploads/tdomf/13281/joomlanyc-logo-web2.png)Late last night here in Australia I was struggling to get to sleep so I jumped on Twitter to see what was going on around the world.

To my luck I stumbled upon the Ustream channel of the JoomlaDay New York. What luck and good timing.

There is plenty of very interesting conversation in regards to the Joomla Platform and a lot of the development that employees from eBay have been working on and contributing back to the Joomla project.

Well worth sitting in and listening in on the conversations.
