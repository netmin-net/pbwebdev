# Peter Bui / Co-Director / Project Lead

Peter is the project lead for many of the web design and development that come through the doors here at PB Web Development. He also is a bit of a Joomla celebrity in that he is the voice of the Joomla Beat Podcast, a weekly podcast produced as a resource for the Joomla community.

** "My main aim when creating a web site is to make it as accessible and semantic as possible. I like a web site to be functional and I don't like making users think." **

Peter has worked with in and with various Government departments around Australia, advertising and web agencies and interactive agencies over the years collecting a huge wealth of knowledge and experience in the digital space. He sees himself as a well rounded web consultant with knowledge in open source technologies such as Joomla and WordPress as well as website deployment and management.

In the last year alone Peter has developed, design and maintained over 80 different web sites from clients around Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom.

Peter now also runs and hosts a popular web design and web development podcast around the Joomla content management system called, the "Joomla Beat Podcast", check it out on the iTunes store.
