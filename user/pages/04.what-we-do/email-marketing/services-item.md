## What it is Email Marketing

Email marketing is a form of direct marketing to your customers, jump straight into their inbox to broadcast your message. Send a personalised email out to your database of recipients to advertise a promotion, gain brand awareness, gauge interest in your products, and much more.

## Customer Benefits

What are the benefits of email marketing? Your customers are notified immediately to receive loyalty promotions and similar benefits. It is significantly cheaper than printed mail-out campaigns, therefore furthering reach and lowering costs. Instantly you will be able to monitor the results, allowing you to track your return on investment. With the ability to see general information on who opens the email and what links they click on, we can track this and report back to you.
