The internet is changing and the modern way to connect between devices and platforms is via an application programming interface (API).

## What Are Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)

APIs are a way for websites, applications and devices to talk to each other and pass information between them using a unified common language format, usually in JSON. An API would provide rules and functions or ways to interact with it.

This common language and ability to talk between systems allows the development of mobile applications, integrations between a website and third party accounting or CRM system or event the transmission of data from a airborne drone to a database on a website/application that can calculate an interpret the data in meaningful ways.

APIs is what powers powerful applications on the Internet such as SalesForce, XERO, Instagram, Twitter and many more.

## How Can We Help

Here at PB Web Development, we have been connecting systems together via APIs to create useful integrated systems passing useful data from one system to another.

A couple examples include:

 * integration of e-commerce websites with XERO accounting software for easier tracking and reporting of sales and inventory
 * website form integration with email campaign systems such as Campaign Monitor and MailChimp or SalesForce lead generation
 * integration of a custom API to a membership portal system helping to design the API as well as the intergace to use the API.
